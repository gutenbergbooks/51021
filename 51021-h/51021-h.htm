<hr class="r10" />


<p>The object of this work is to give, in a connected
form, a summary of the development of the vegetable
kingdom in geological time.</p>

<p>To the geologist and botanist the subject is one of
importance with reference to their special pursuits, and
one on which it has not been easy to find any convenient
manual of information. It is hoped that its treatment
in the present volume will also be found sufficiently
simple and popular to be attractive to the
general reader.</p>

<p>In a work of so limited dimensions, detailed descriptions
cannot be given, except occasionally by way of
illustration; but references to authorities will be made
in foot-notes, and certain details, which may be useful to
collectors and students, will be placed in notes appended
to the chapters, so as not to encumber the text.</p>

<p>The illustrations of this work are for the most part
original; but some of them have previously appeared
in special papers of the author.</p>

<p class="caption3">PRELIMINARY IDEAS OF GEOLOGICAL CHRONOLOGY AND
OF THE CLASSIFICATION OF PLANTS.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> knowledge of fossil plants and of the history of
the vegetable kingdom has, until recently, been so fragmentary
that it seemed hopeless to attempt a detailed
treatment of the subject of this little book. Our stores
of knowledge have, however, been rapidly accumulating
in recent years, and we have now arrived at a stage when
every new discovery serves to render useful and intelligible
a vast number of facts previously fragmentary and of
uncertain import.</p>

<p>The writer of this work, born in a district rich in
fossil plants, began to collect and work at these as a
boy, in connection with botanical and geological pursuits.
He has thus been engaged in the study of fossil plants
for nearly half a century, and, while he has published
much on the subject, has endeavoured carefully to keep
within the sphere of ascertained facts, and has made it
a specialty to collect, as far as possible, what has been
published by others. He has also enjoyed opportunities
of correspondence or personal intercourse with most of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">« 2 »</a></span>
the more eminent workers in the subject. Now, in the
evening of his days, he thinks it right to endeavour to
place before the world a summary of facts and of his own
matured conclusions&mdash;feeling, however, that nothing can
be final in this matter; and that he can only hope to
sketch the present aspect of the subject, and to point the
way to new developments, which must go on long after
he shall have passed away.</p>

<p>The subject is one which has the disadvantage of presupposing
some knowledge of the geological history of
the earth, and of the classification and structures of modern
plants; and in order that all who may please to read
the following pages may be placed, as nearly as possible,
on the same level, this introductory chapter will be devoted
to a short statement of the general facts of geological
chronology, and of the natural divisions of the vegetable
kingdom in their relations to that chronology.</p>

<p>The crust of the earth, as we somewhat modestly term
that portion of its outer shell which is open to our observation,
consists of many beds of rock superimposed on
each other, and which must have been deposited successively,
beginning with the lowest. This is proved by the
structure of the beds themselves, by the markings on
their surfaces, and by the remains of animals and plants
which they contain; all these appearances indicating that
each successive bed must have been the surface before it
was covered by the next.</p>

<p>As these beds of rock were mostly formed under water,
and of material derived from the waste of land, they are
not universal, but occur in those places where there were
extensive areas of water receiving detritus from the land.
Further, as the distinction of land and water arises primarily
from the shrinkage of the mass of the earth, and
from the consequent collapse of the crust in some places
and ridging of it up in others, it follows that there have,
from the earliest geological periods, been deep ocean-basins,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">« 3 »</a></span>
ridges of elevated land, and broad plateaus intervening
between the ridges, and which were at some times
under water, and at other times land, with many intermediate
phases. The settlement and crumpling of the
crust were not continuous, but took place at intervals;
and each such settlement produced not only a ridging up
along certain lines, but also an emergence of the plains
or plateaus. Thus at all times there have been ridges of
folded rock constituting mountain-ranges, flat expansions
of continental plateau, sometimes dry and sometimes submerged,
and deep ocean-basins, never except in some of
their shallower portions elevated into land.</p>

<p>By the study of the successive beds, more especially
of those deposited in the times of continental submergence,
we obtain a table of geological chronology which
expresses the several stages of the formation of the earth&rsquo;s
crust, from that early time when a solid shell first formed
on our nascent planet to the present day. By collecting
the fossil remains embedded in the several layers and
placing these in chronological order, we obtain in like
manner histories of animal and plant life parallel to the
physical changes indicated by the beds themselves. The
facts as to the sequence we obtain from the study of exposures
in cliffs, cuttings, quarries, and mines; and by
correlating these local sections in a great number of places,
we obtain our general table of succession; though it is to
be observed that in some single exposures or series of
exposures, like those in the great canons of Colorado, or
on the coasts of Great Britain, we can often in one locality
see nearly the whole sequence of beds. Let us observe
here also that, though we can trace these series of deposits
over the whole of the surfaces of the continents, yet if
the series could be seen in one spot, say in one shaft sunk
through the whole thickness of the earth&rsquo;s crust, this
would be sufficient for our purpose, so far as the history
of life is concerned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">« 4 »</a></span></p>

<p>The evidence is similar to that obtained by Schliemann
on the site of Troy, where, in digging through successive
layers of <i>débris</i>, he found the objects deposited by
successive occupants of the site, from the time of the
Roman Empire back to the earliest tribes, whose flint
weapons and the ashes of their fires rest on the original
surface of the ground.</p>

<p>Let us now tabulate the whole geological succession
with the history of animals and plants associated with it:</p>

<p>It will be observed, since only the latest of the systems
of formations in this table belongs to the period of
human history, that the whole lapse of time embraced in
the table must be enormous. If we suppose the modern
period to have continued for say ten thousand years, and
each of the others to have been equal to it, we shall require
two hundred thousand years for the whole. There
is, however, reason to believe, from the great thickness of
the formations and the slowness of the deposition of many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">« 5 »</a></span>
of them in the older systems, that they must have required
vastly greater time. Taking these criteria into
account, it has been estimated that the time-ratios for
the first three great ages may be as one for the Kainozoic
to three for the Mesozoic and twelve for the Palæozoic,
with as much for the Eozoic as for the Palæozoic. This is
Dana&rsquo;s estimate. Another, by Hull and Houghton, gives
the following ratios: Azoic, 34&middot;3 per cent.; Palæozoic,
42&middot;5 per cent.; Mesozoic and Kainozoic, 23&middot;2 per cent.
It is further held that the modern period is much shorter
than the other periods of the Kainozoic, so that our
geological table may have to be measured by millions of
years instead of thousands.</p>

<p>We cannot, however, attach any certain and definite
value in years to geological time, but must content ourselves
with the general statement that it has been vastly
long in comparison to that covered by human history.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind this great duration of geological time,
and the fact that it probably extends from a period when
the earth was intensely heated, its crust thin, and its continents
as yet unformed, it will be evident that the conditions
of life in the earlier geologic periods may have
been very different from those which obtained later.
When we further take into account the vicissitudes of
land and water which have occurred, we shall see that
such changes must have produced very great differences
of climate. The warm equatorial waters have in all
periods, as superficial oceanic currents, been main agents
in the diffusion of heat over the surface of the earth, and
their distribution to north and south must have been
determined mainly by the extent and direction of land,
though it may also have been modified by the changes in
the astronomical relations and period of the earth, and
the form of its orbit.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> We know by the evidence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">« 6 »</a></span>
fossil plants that changes of this kind have occurred so
great as, on the one hand, to permit the plants of warm
temperate regions to exist within the Arctic Circle; and,
on the other, to drive these plants into the tropics and
to replace them by Arctic forms. It is evident also that
in those periods when the continental areas were largely
submerged, there might be an excessive amount of moisture
in the atmosphere, greatly modifying the climate, in
so far as plants are concerned.</p>

<p>Let us now consider the history of the vegetable kingdom
as indicated in the few notes in the right-hand
column of the table.</p>

<p>The most general subdivision of plants is into the two
great series of Cryptogams, or those which have no manifest
flowers, and produce minute spores instead of seeds;
and Phænogams, or those which possess flowers and produce
seeds containing an embryo of the future plant.</p>

<p>The Cryptogams may be subdivided into the following
three groups:</p>

<p>1. <i>Thallogens</i>, cellular plants not distinctly distinguishable
into stem and leaf. These are the Fungi, the
Lichens, and the Algæ, or sea-weeds.</p>

<p>2. <i>Anogens</i>, having stem and foliage, but wholly cellular.
These are the Mosses and Liverworts.</p>

<p>3. Acrogens, which have long tubular fibres as well as
cells in their composition, and thus have the capacity of
attaining a more considerable magnitude. These are the
Ferns (<i>Filices</i>), the Mare&rsquo;s-tails (<i>Equisetaceæ</i>), and the
Club-mosses (<i>Lycopodiaceæ</i>), and a curious little group
of aquatic plants called Rhizocarps (<i>Rhizocarpeæ</i>).</p>

<p>The Phænogams are all vascular, but they differ much
in the simplicity or complexity of their flowers or seeds.
On this ground they admit of a twofold division:</p>

<p>1. <i>Gymnosperms</i>, or those which bear naked seeds
not enclosed in fruits. They are the Pines and their

<p>2. <i>Angiosperms</i>, which produce true fruits enclosing
the seeds. In this group there are two well-marked subdivisions
differing in the structure of the seed and stem.
They are the <i>Endogens</i>, or inside growers, with seeds having
one seed-leaf only, as the grasses and the palms; and
the <i>Exogens</i>, having outside-growing woody stems, and
seeds with two seed-leaves. Most of the ordinary forest-trees
of temperate climates belong to this group.</p>

<p>On referring to the geological table, it will be seen
that there is a certain rough correspondence between the
order of rank of plants and the order of their appearance
in time. The oldest plants that we certainly know are
Algæ, and with these there are plants apparently with
the structures of Thallophytes but the habit of trees, and
which, for want of a better name, I may call <i>Protogens</i>.
Plants akin to the Rhizocarps also appear very early.
Next in order we find forests in which gigantic Ferns and
Lycopods and Mare&rsquo;s-tails predominate, and are associated
with pines. Succeeding these we have a reign of Gymnosperms,
and in the later formations we find the higher
Phænogams dominant. Thus there is an advance in
elevation and complexity along with the advance in
geological time, but connected with the remarkable fact
that in earlier times low groups attain to an elevation
unexampled in later times, when their places are occupied
with plants of higher type.</p>

<p>It is this historical development that we have to trace
in the following pages, and it will be the most simple
and at the same time the most instructive method to
consider it in the order of time.</p>

<p class="caption3">VEGETATION OF THE LAURENTIAN AND EARLY PALÆOZOIC&mdash;QUESTIONS AS TO ALGÆ.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Oldest</span> of all the formations known to geologists, and
representing perhaps the earliest rocks produced after our
earth had ceased to be a molten mass, are the hard, crystalline,
and much-contorted rocks named by the late Sir
W. E. Logan Laurentian, and which are largely developed
in the northern parts of North America and Europe, and
in many other regions. So numerous and extensive, indeed,
are the exposures of these rocks, that we have good
reason to believe that they underlie all the other formations
of our continents, and are even world-wide in their
distribution. In the lower part of this great system of
rocks which, in some places at least, is thirty thousand
feet in thickness, we find no traces of the existence of
any living thing on the earth. But, in the middle portion
of the Laurentian, rocks are found which indicate
that there were already land and water, and that the waters
and possibly the land were already tenanted by living
beings. The great beds of limestone which exist in this
part of the system furnish one indication of this. In the
later geological formations the limestones are mostly organic&mdash;that
is, they consist of accumulated remains of
shells, corals, and other hard parts of marine animals,
which are composed of calcium carbonate, which the animals
obtain directly from their food, and indirectly from
the calcareous matter dissolved in the sea-water. In like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">« 9 »</a></span>
manner great beds of iron-ore exist in the Laurentian;
but in later formations the determining cause of the
accumulation of such beds is the partial deoxidation and
solution of the peroxide of iron by the agency of organic
matter. Besides this, certain forms known as <i>Eozoon
Canadense</i> have been recognised in the Laurentian limestones,
which indicate the presence at least of one of the
lower types of marine animals. Where animal life is, we
may fairly infer the existence of vegetable life as well,
since the plant is the only producer of food for the animal.
But we are not left merely to this inference. Great
quantities of carbon or charcoal in the form of the substance
known as graphite or plumbago exist in the
Laurentian. Now, in more recent formations we have
deposits of coal and bituminous matter, and we know
that these have arisen from the accumulation and slow
putrefaction of masses of vegetable matter. Further, in
places where igneous action has affected the beds, we
find that ordinary coal has been changed into anthracite
and graphite, that bituminous shales have been converted
into graphitic shales, and that cracks filled with soft
bituminous matter have ultimately become changed into
veins of graphite. When, therefore, we find in the Laurentian
thick beds of graphite and beds of limestone
charged with detached grains and crystals of this substance,
and graphitic gneisses and schists and veins of
graphite traversing the beds, we recognise the same
phenomena that are apparent in later formations containing
vegetable <i>débris</i>.</p>

<p>The carbon thus occurring in the Laurentian is not
to be regarded as exceptional or rare, but is widely distributed
and of large amount. In Canada more especially
the deposits are very considerable.</p>

<p>The graphite of the Laurentian of Canada occurs both
in beds and in veins, and in such a manner as to show
that its origin and deposition are contemporaneous with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">« 10 »</a></span>
those of the containing rock. Sir William Logan states<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
that &ldquo;the deposits of plumbago generally occur in the
limestones or in their immediate vicinity, and granular
varieties of the rock often contain large crystalline plates
of plumbago. At other times this mineral is so finely
disseminated as to give a bluish-grey colour to the limestone,
and the distribution of bands thus coloured seems
to mark the stratification of the rock.&rdquo; He further
states: &ldquo;The plumbago is not confined to the limestones;
large crystalline scales of it are occasionally disseminated
in pyroxene rock, and sometimes in quartzite
and in feldspathic rocks, or even in magnetic oxide of
iron.&rdquo; In addition to these bedded forms, there are also
true veins in which graphite occurs associated with calcite,
quartz, orthoclase, or pyroxene, and either in disseminated
scales, in detached masses, or in bands or layers
&ldquo;separated from each other and from the wall-rock by
feldspar, pyroxene, and quartz.&rdquo; Dr. Hunt also mentions
the occurrence of finely granular varieties, and of
that peculiarly waved and corrugated variety simulating
fossil wood, though really a mere form of laminated
structure, which also occurs at Warrensburg, New York,
and at the Marinski mine in Siberia. Many of the veins
are not true fissures, but rather constitute a network of
shrinkage cracks or segregation veins traversing in countless
numbers the containing rock, and most irregular in
their dimensions, so that they often resemble strings of
nodular masses. It is most probable that the graphite of
the veins was originally introduced as a liquid or plastic
hydrocarbon; but in whatever way introduced, the character
of the veins indicates that in the case of the greater
number of them the carbonaceous material must have
been derived from the bedded rocks traversed by these
veins, to which it bears the same relation with the veins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">« 11 »</a></span>
of bitumen found in the bituminous shales of the Carboniferous
and Silurian rocks. Nor can there be any
doubt that the graphite found in the beds has been deposited
along with the calcareous matter or muddy and
sandy sediment of which these beds were originally composed.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

Geological Society,&rdquo; 1876.</p></div>

<p>The quantity of graphite in the Lower Laurentian
series is enormous. Some years ago, in the township of
Buckingham, on the Ottawa River, I examined a band of
limestone believed to be a continuation of that described
by Sir W. E. Logan as the Green Lake limestone. It
was estimated to amount, with some thin interstratified
bands of gneiss, to a thickness of six hundred feet or
more, and was found to be filled with disseminated crystals
of graphite and veins of the mineral to such an extent
as to constitute in some places one-fourth of the whole;
and, making every allowance for the poorer portions, this
band cannot contain in all a less vertical thickness of
pure graphite than from twenty to thirty feet. In the
adjoining township of Lochaber Sir W. E. Logan notices
a band from twenty-five to thirty feet thick, reticulated
with graphite veins to such an extent as to be mined with
profit for the mineral. At another place in the same district
a bed of graphite from ten to twelve feet thick, and
yielding 20 per cent, of the pure material, is worked.
As it appears in the excavation made by the quarrymen,
it resembled a bed of coal; and a block from this bed,
about four feet thick, was a prominent object in the
Canadian department of the Colonial Exhibition of 1886.
When it is considered that graphite occurs in similar
abundance at several other horizons, in beds of limestone
which have been ascertained by Sir W. E. Logan to have
an aggregate thickness of thirty-five hundred feet, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">« 12 »</a></span>
scarcely an exaggeration to maintain that the quantity of
carbon in the Laurentian is equal to that in similar areas
of the Carboniferous system. It is also to be observed
that an immense area in Canada appears to be occupied
by these graphitic and <i>Eozoon</i> limestones, and that rich
graphitic deposits exist in the continuation of this system
in the State of New York, while in rocks believed to
be of this age near St. John, New Brunswick, there is a
very thick bed of graphitic limestone, and associated with
it three regular beds of graphite, having an aggregate
thickness of about five feet.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p>It may fairly be assumed that in the present world,
and in those geological periods with whose organic remains
we are more familiar than with those of the Laurentian,
there is no other source of unoxidized carbon in
rocks than that furnished by organic matter, and that
this has obtained its carbon in all cases, in the first instance,
from the deoxidation of carbonic acid by living
plants. No other source of carbon can, I believe, be
imagined in the Laurentian period. We may, however,
suppose either that the graphitic matter of the Laurentian
has been accumulated in beds like those of coal, or that
it has consisted of diffused bituminous matter similar to
that in more modern bituminous shales and bituminous
and oil-bearing limestones. The beds of graphite near
St. John, some of those in the gneiss at Ticonderoga in
New York, and at Lochaber and Buckingham, and elsewhere
in Canada, are so pure and regular that one might
fairly compare them with the graphitic coal of Rhode
Island. These instances, however, are exceptional, and
the greater part of the disseminated and vein graphite
might rather be likened in its mode of occurrence to the
bituminous matter in bituminous shales and limestones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">« 13 »</a></span></p>

<p>We may compare the disseminated graphite to that
which we find in those districts of Canada in which Silurian
and Devonian bituminous shales and limestones have
been metamorphosed and converted into graphitic rocks
not very dissimilar to those in the less altered portions of
the Laurentian.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> In like manner it seems probable that
the numerous reticulating veins of graphite may have
been formed by the segregation of bituminous matter into
fissures and planes of least resistance, in the manner in
which such veins occur in modern bituminous limestones
and shales. Such bituminous veins occur in the Lower
Carboniferous limestone and shale of Dorchester and
Hillsborough, New Brunswick, with an arrangement very
similar to that of the veins of graphite; and in the Quebec
rocks of Point Levi, veins attaining to a thickness of
more than a foot, are filled with a coaly matter having a
transverse columnar structure, and regarded by Logan
and Hunt as an altered bitumen. These palæozoic analogies
would lead us to infer that the larger part of the
Laurentian graphite falls under the second class of deposits
above mentioned, and that, if of vegetable origin,
the organic matter must have been thoroughly disintegrated
and bituminised before it was changed into
graphite. This would also give a probability that the
vegetation implied was aquatic, or at least that it was
accumulated under water.</p>

p. 599.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Hunt has, however, observed an indication of terrestrial
vegetation, or at least of subaërial decay, in the
great beds of Laurentian iron-ore. These, if formed in
the same manner as more modern deposits of this kind,
would imply the reducing and solvent action of substances
produced in the decay of plants. In this case
such great ore-beds as that of Hull, on the Ottawa, seventy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">« 14 »</a></span>
feet thick, or that near Newborough, two hundred feet
thick,<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> must represent a corresponding quantity of vegetable
matter which has totally disappeared. It may be
added that similar demands on vegetable matter as a
deoxidising agent are made by the beds and veins of
metallic sulphides of the Laurentian, though some of
the latter are no doubt of later date than the Laurentian
rocks themselves.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_F_6" id="Footnote_F_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_F_6"><span class="label">[F]</span></a> &ldquo;Geology of Canada,&rdquo; 1863.</p></div>

<p>It would be very desirable to confirm such conclusions
as those above deduced by the evidence of actual microscopic
structure. It is to be observed, however, that
when, in more modern sediments, Algæ have been converted
into bituminous matter, we cannot ordinarily obtain
any structural evidence of the origin of such bitumen,
and in the graphitic slates and limestones derived from
the metamorphosis of such rocks no organic structure
remains. It is true that, in certain bituminous shales
and limestones of the Silurian system, shreds of organic
tissue can sometimes be detected, and in some cases, as
in the Lower Silurian limestone of the La Cloche Mountains
in Canada, the pores of brachiopodous shells and
the cells of corals have been penetrated by black bituminous
matter, forming what may be regarded as natural
injections, sometimes of much beauty. In correspondence
with this, while in some Laurentian graphitic rocks, as,
for instance, in the compact graphite of Clarendon, the
carbon presents a curdled appearance due to segregation,
and precisely similar to that of the bitumen in more
modern bituminous rocks, I can detect in the graphitic
limestones occasional fibrous structures which may be
remains of plants, and in some specimens vermicular
lines, which I believe to be tubes of Eozoon penetrated
by matter once bituminous, but now in the state of
graphite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">« 15 »</a></span></p>

<p>When palæozoic land-plants have been converted into
graphite, they sometimes perfectly retain their structure.
Mineral charcoal, with structure, exists in the graphitic
coal of Rhode Island. The fronds of ferns, with their
minutest veins perfect, are preserved in the Devonian
shales of St. John, in the state of graphite; and in the
same formation there are trunks of Conifers (<i>Dadoxylon
Ouangondianum</i>) in which the material of the cell-walls
has been converted into graphite, while their cavities
have been filled with calcareous spar and quartz, the
finest structures being preserved quite as well as in comparatively
unaltered specimens from the coal-formation.<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a>
No structures so perfect have as yet been detected in the
Laurentian, though in the largest of the three graphitic
beds at St. John there appear to be fibrous structures,
which I believe may indicate the existence of land-plants.
This graphite is composed of contorted and slickensided
laminæ, much like those of some bituminous shales and
coarse coals; and in these are occasional small pyritous
masses which show hollow carbonaceous fibres, in some
cases presenting obscure indications of lateral pores. I
regard these indications, however, as uncertain; and it is
not as yet fully ascertained that these beds at St. John
are on the same geological horizon with the Lower Laurentian
of Canada, though they certainly underlie the
Primordial series of the Acadian group, and are separated
from it by beds having the character of the Huronian.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_G_7" id="Footnote_G_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_G_7"><span class="label">[G]</span></a> &ldquo;Acadian Geology,&rdquo; p. 535. In calcined specimens the structures
remain in the graphite after decalcification by an acid.</p></div>

<p>There is thus no absolute impossibility that distinct
organic tissues may be found in the Laurentian graphite,
if formed from land-plants, more especially if any plants
existed at that time having true woody or vascular tissues;
but it cannot with certainty be affirmed that such tissues
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">« 16 »</a></span>
have been found. It is possible, however, that in the
Laurentian period the vegetation of the land may have
consisted wholly of cellular plants, as, for example,
mosses and lichens; and if so, there would be comparatively
little hope of the distinct preservation of their
forms or tissues, or of our being able to distinguish the
remains of land-plants from those of Algæ.</p>

<p>We may sum up these facts and considerations in the
following statements: First, that somewhat obscure
traces of organic structure can be detected in the Laurentian
graphite; secondly, that the general arrangement
and microscopic structure of the substance corresponds
with that of the carbonaceous and bituminous matters in
marine formations of more modern date; thirdly, that if
the Laurentian graphite has been derived from vegetable
matter, it has only undergone a metamorphosis similar in
kind to that which organic matter in metamorphosed
sediments of later age has experienced; fourthly, that the
association of the graphitic matter with organic limestone,
beds of iron-ore, and metallic sulphides greatly
strengthens the probability of its vegetable origin; fifthly,
that when we consider the immense thickness and extent
of the Eozoonal and graphitic limestones and iron-ore
deposits of the Laurentian, if we admit the organic origin
of the limestone and graphite, we must be prepared to
believe that the life of that early period, though it may
have existed under low forms, was most copiously developed,
and that it equalled, perhaps surpassed, in its results,
in the way of geological accumulation, that of any
subsequent period.</p>

<p>Many years ago, at the meeting of the American Association
in Albany, the writer was carrying into the
room of the Geological Section a mass of fossil wood from
the Devonian of Gaspé, when he met the late Professor
Agassiz, and remarked that the specimen was the remains
of a Devonian tree contemporaneous with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">« 17 »</a></span>
fishes of that age. &ldquo;How I wish I could sit under its
shade!&rdquo; was the smiling reply of the great zoölogist; and
when we think of the great accumulations of Laurentian
carbon, and that we are entirely ignorant of the forms
and structures of the vegetation which produced it, we
can scarcely suppress a feeling of disappointment. Some
things, however, we can safely infer from the facts that
are known, and these it may be well to mention.</p>

<p>The climate and atmosphere of the Laurentian may
have been well adapted for the sustenance of vegetable
life. We can scarcely doubt that the internal heat of the
earth still warmed the waters of the sea, and these warm
waters must have diffused great quantities of mists and
vapours over the land, giving a moist and equable if not a
very clear atmosphere. The vast quantities of carbon dioxide
afterwards sealed up in limestones and carbonaceous
beds must also have still floated in the atmosphere and
must have supplied abundance of the carbon, which constitutes
the largest ingredient in vegetable tissues. Under
these circumstances the whole world must have resembled
a damp, warm greenhouse, and plants loving such an atmosphere
could have grown luxuriantly. In these circumstances
the lower forms of aquatic vegetation and
those that love damp, warm air and wet soil would have
been at home.</p>

<p>If we ask more particularly what kinds of plants
might be expected to be introduced in such circumstances,
we may obtain some information from the vegetation of
the succeeding Palæozoic age, when such conditions still
continued to a modified extent. In this period the club-mosses,
ferns, and mare&rsquo;s-tails engrossed the world and
grew to sizes and attained degrees of complexity of structure
not known in modern times. In the previous Laurentian
age something similar may have happened to
Algæ, to Fungi, to Lichens, to Liverworts, and Mosses.
The Algæ may have attained to gigantic dimensions, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">« 18 »</a></span>
may have even ascended out of the water in some of their
forms. These comparatively simple cellular and tubular
structures, now degraded to the humble position of flat
lichens or soft or corky fungi, or slender cellular mosses,
may have been so strengthened and modified as to constitute
forest-trees. This would be quite in harmony with
what is observed in the development of other plants in
primitive geological times; and a little later in this history
we shall see that there is evidence in the flora of the
Silurian of a survival of such forms.</p>

<p>It may be that no geologist or botanist will ever be
able to realise these dreams of the past. But, on the
other hand, it is quite possible that some fortunate chance
may have somewhere preserved specimens of Laurentian
plants showing their structure.</p>

<p>In any case we have here presented to us the strange
and startling fact that the remarkable arrangement of
protoplasmic matter and chlorophyll, which enables the
vegetable cell to perform, with the aid of solar light, the
miracle of decomposing carbon dioxide and water, and
forming with them woody and corky tissues, had already
been introduced upon the earth. It has been well said
that no amount of study of inorganic nature would ever
have enabled any one to anticipate the possibility of the
construction of an apparatus having the chemical powers
of the living vegetable cell. Yet this most marvellous
structure seems to have been introduced in the full plenitude
of its powers in the Laurentian age.</p>

<p>Whether this early Laurentian vegetation was the
means of sustaining any animal life other than marine
Protozoa, we do not know. It may have existed for its
own sake alone, or merely as a purifier of the atmosphere,
in preparation for the future introduction of land-animals.
The fact that there have existed, even in modern
times, oceanic islands rich in vegetation, yet untenanted
by the higher forms of animal life, prepares us to believe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">« 19 »</a></span>
that such conditions may have been general or universal
in the primeval times we are here considering.</p>

<p>If we ask to what extent the carbon extracted from
the atmosphere and stored up in the earth has been,
or is likely to be, useful to man, the answer must be
that it is not in a state to enable it to be used as mineral
fuel. It has, however, important uses in the arts,
though at present the supply seems rather in excess of
the demand, and it may well be that there are uses of
graphite still undiscovered, and to which it will yet be
applied.</p>

<p>Finally, it is deserving of notice that, if Laurentian
graphite indicates vegetable life, it indicates this in vast
profusion. That incalculable quantities of vegetable
matter have been oxidised and have disappeared we may
believe on the evidence of the vast beds of iron-ore; and,
in regard to that preserved as graphite, it is certain that
every inch of that mineral must indicate many feet of
crude vegetable matter.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that, in ascending from the Laurentian,
we do not at first appear to advance in evidences
of plant-life. The Huronian age, which succeeded the
Laurentian, seems to have been a disturbed and unquiet
time, and, except in certain bands of iron-ore and some
dark slates coloured with carbonaceous matter, we find in
it no evidence of vegetation. In the Cambrian a great
subsidence of our continents began, which went on,
though with local intermissions and reversals, all through
the Siluro-Cambrian or Ordovician time. These times
were, for this reason, remarkable for the great abundance
and increase of marine animals rather than of land-plants.
Still, there are some traces of land vegetation, and we may
sketch first the facts of this kind which are known, and
then advert to some points relating to the earlier Algæ,
or sea-weeds.</p>

<p>An eminent Swedish geologist, Linnarsson, has described,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">« 20 »</a></span>
under the name of <i>Eophyton</i>, certain impressions
on old Cambrian rocks in Sweden, and which certainly
present very plant-like forms. They want, however, any
trace of carbonaceous matter, and seem rather to be
grooves or marks cut in clay by the limbs or tails of some
aquatic animal, and afterwards filled up and preserved by
succeeding deposits. After examining large series of
these specimens from Sweden, and from rocks of similar
age in Canada, I confess that I have no faith in their
vegetable nature.</p>

<p>The oldest plants known to me, and likely to have
been of higher grade than Algæ, are specimens kindly
presented to me by Dr. Alleyne Nicholson, of Aberdeen,
and which he had named <i>Buthotrephis Harknessii</i><a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> and
<i>B. radiata</i>. They are from the Skiddaw rocks of Cumberland.
On examining these specimens, and others
subsequently collected in the same locality by Dr. Gr. M.
Dawson, while convinced by their form and carbonaceous
character that they are really plants, I am inclined to refer
them not to Algæ, but probably to Rhizocarps. They
consist of slender branching stems, with whorls of elongate
and pointed leaves, resembling the genus <i>Annularia</i> of
the coal formation. I am inclined to believe that both
of Nicholson&rsquo;s species are parts of one plant, and for
this I have proposed the generic name <i>Protannularia</i>
(<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>). Somewhat higher in the Siluro-Cambrian, in
the Cincinnati group of America, Lesquereux has found
some minute radiated leaves, referred by him to the genus
<i>Sphenophyllum</i>,<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> which is also allied to Rhizocarps. Still
more remarkable is the discovery in the same beds of a
stem with rhombic areoles or leaf-bases, to which the
name <i>Protostigma</i> has been given.<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> If a plant, this may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">« 21 »</a></span>
have been allied to the club-mosses. This seems to be
all that we at present know of land-vegetation in the
Siluro-Cambrian. So far as the remains go, they indicate
the presence of the
families of Rhizocarps

<p>If we ascend
into the Upper Silurian,
or Silurian
proper, the evidences
of land vegetation
somewhat
increase. In 1859 I
described, in &ldquo;The
Journal of the Geological
Society&rdquo; of
London, a remarkable
tree from the
Lower Erian of
Gaspé, under the
name <i>Prototaxites</i>,
but for which I
now prefer the
name <i>Nematophyton</i>.
When in London,
in 1870, I obtained permission to examine certain
specimens of spore-cases or seeds from the Upper
Ludlow (Silurian) formation of England, and which
had been described by Sir Joseph Hooker under the
name <i>Pachytheca</i>. In the same slabs with these I
found fragments of fossil wood identical with those
of the Gaspé plant. Still later I recognised similar
fragments associated also with <i>Pachytheca</i> in the Silurian
of Cape Bon Ami, New Brunswick. Lastly, Dr.
Hicks has discovered similar wood, and also similar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">« 22 »</a></span>
fruits, in the Denbighshire grits, at the base of the Silurian.<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a></p>

<p>From comparison of this singular wood, the structure
of which is represented in Figs. <a href="#fig2">2</a>, <a href="#fig3">3</a>, and <a href="#fig4">4</a>, with the <i>débris</i>
of fossil taxine woods, mineralised after long maceration
in water, I was inclined to regard <i>Prototaxites</i>, or, as I
have more recently named it, <i>Nematophyton</i>, as a primeval
gymnosperm allied to those trees which Unger had
described from the Erian of Thuringia, under the name
<i>Aporoxylon</i>.<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> Later examples of more lax tissues from
branches or young stems, and the elaborate examinations
kindly undertaken for me by Professor Penhallow and
referred to in a note to this chapter, have induced me to
modify this view, and to hold that the tissues of these
singular trees, which seem to have existed from the beginning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">« 24 »</a></span>
of the Silurian age and to have finally disappeared
in the early Erian, are altogether distinct from
any form of vegetation hitherto known, and are possibly
survivors of that prototypal flora to which I have already
referred. They are trees of large size, with a coaly bark
and large spreading roots, having the surface of the stem
smooth or irregularly ribbed, but with a nodose or jointed
appearance. Internally, they show a tissue of long, cylindrical
tubes, traversed by a complex network of horizontal
tubes thinner walled and of smaller size. The tubes are
arranged in concentric zones, which, if annual rings, would
in some specimens indicate an age of one hundred and
fifty years. There are also radiating spaces, which I was
at first disposed to regard as true medullary rays, or which
at least indicate a radiating arrangement of the tissue.
They now seem to be spaces extending from the centre
towards the circumference of the stem, and to have contained
bundles of tubes gathered from the general tissue
and extending outward perhaps to organs or appendages
on the surface. Carruthers has suggested a resemblance
to Algæ, and has even proposed to change the name to
<i>Nematophycus</i>, or &ldquo;thread-sea-weed&rdquo;; but the resemblance
is by no means clear, and it would be quite as reasonable
to compare the tissue to that of some Fungi or Lichens,
or even to suppose that a plant composed of cylindrical
tubes has been penetrated by the mycelium or spawn
of a dry-rot fungus. But the tissues are too constant and
too manifestly connected with each other to justify this
last supposition. That the plant grew on land I cannot
doubt, from its mode of occurrence; that it was of durable
and resisting character is shown by its state of preservation;
and the structure of the seeds called <i>Pachytheca</i>,
with their constant association with these trees, give countenance
to the belief that they are the fruit of Nematophyton.
Of the foliage or fronds of these strange
plants we unfortunately know nothing. They seem, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">« 25 »</a></span>
to realise the idea of arboreal plants having structures
akin to those of thallophytes, but with seeds so
large and complex that they can scarcely be regarded as
mere spores. They should perhaps constitute a separate
class or order to which the name <i>Nematodendreæ</i> may
be given, and of which <i>Nematophyton</i> will constitute one
genus and <i>Aporoxylon</i> of Unger another.<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a></p>

1882, for full description of these fossils.</p></div>

<p>Another question arises as to the possible relation of
these plants to other trees known by their external forms.
The <i>Protostigma</i> of Lesquereux has already been referred
to, and Claypole has described a tree from the Clinton
group of the United States, with large ovate leaf-bases, to
which he has given the name <i>Glyptodendron</i>.<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a> If the
markings on these plants are really leaf-bases, they can
scarcely have been connected with <i>Nematophyton</i>, because
that tree shows no such surface-markings, though, as we
have seen, it had bundles of tubes passing diagonally to
the surface. These plants were more probably trees with
an axis of barred vessels and thick, cellular bark, like the
<i>Lepidodendron</i> of later periods, to be noticed in the sequel.
Dr. Hicks has also described from the same series of beds
which afforded the fragments of Nematophyton certain
carbonised dichotomous stems, which he has named <i>Berwynia</i>.
It is just possible that these plants may have
belonged to the Nematodendreæ. The thick and dense
coaly matter which they show resembles the bark of these
trees, the longitudinal striation in some of them may
represent the fibrous structure, and the lateral projections
which have been compared to leaves or leaf-bases may
correspond with the superficial eminences of <i>Nematophyton</i>,
and the spirally arranged punctures which it shows
on its surface. In this case I should be disposed to regard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">« 26 »</a></span>
the supposed stigmaria-like roots as really stems,
and the supposed rootlets as short, spine-like rudimentary
leaves. All such comparisons must, however, in the
mean time be regarded as conjectural. We seem, however,
to have here a type of tree very dissimilar to any
even of the later Palæozoic age, which existed throughout
the Silurian, and probably further back, which ceased
to exist early in the Erian age, and before the appearance
of the ordinary coniferous and lepidodendroid trees.
May it not have been a survivor of an old arboreal flora
extending back even to the Laurentian itself?</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_O_15" id="Footnote_O_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_O_15"><span class="label">[O]</span></a> &ldquo;American Journal of Science,&rdquo; 1878.</p></div>

<p>Multitudes of markings occurring on the surfaces of
the older rocks have been referred to the Algæ or sea-weeds,
and indeed this group has been a sort of refuge for
the destitute to which palæontologists have been accustomed
to refer any anomalous or inexplicable form which,
while probably organic, could not be definitely referred to
the animal kingdom. There can be no question that some
of these are truly marine plants; and that plants of this
kind occur in formations older than those in which we first
find land-plants, and that they have continued to inhabit
the sea down to the present time. It is also true that the
oldest of these Algæ closely resemble in form plants of
this kind still existing; and, since their simple cellular
structures and soft tissues are scarcely ever preserved,
their general forms are all that we can know, so that their
exact resemblance to or difference from modern types can
rarely be determined. For the same reasons it has proved
difficult clearly to distinguish them from mere inorganic
markings or the traces of animals, and the greatest divergence
of opinion has occurred in recent times on these
subjects, as any one can readily understand who consults
the voluminous and well-illustrated memoirs of Nathorst,
Williamson, Saporta, and Delgado.</p>

<p>The author of this work has given much attention to
these remains, and has not been disposed to claim for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">« 27 »</a></span>
vegetable kingdom so many of them as some of his contemporaries.<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a>
The considerations which seem most important
in making such distinctions are the following:
1. The presence or absence of carbonaceous matter.
True Algæ not infrequently present at least a thin film of
carbon representing their organic matter, and this is the
more likely to occur in their case, as organic matters
buried in marine deposits and not exposed to atmospheric
oxidation are very likely to be preserved. 2. In the
absence of organic matter, the staining of the containing
rock, the disappearance or deoxidation of its ferruginous
colouring matter, or the presence of iron pyrite may indicate
the removal of organic matter by decay. 3. When
organic matter and indications of it are altogether absent,
and form alone remains, we have to distinguish from Algæ,
trails and burrows similar to those of aquatic animals,
casts of shrinkage-cracks, water-marks, and rill-marks
widely diffused over the surfaces of beds. 4. Markings
depressed on the upper surfaces of beds, and filled with
the material of the succeeding layer, are usually mere impressions.
The cases of possible exceptions to this are
very rare. On the contrary, there are not infrequently
forms in relief on the surfaces of rocks which are not
Algæ, but may be shallow burrows arched upward on top,
or castings of worms thrown up upon the surface. Sometimes,
however, they may have been left by denudation
of the surrounding material, just as footprints on dry
snow remain in relief after the surrounding loose material
has been drifted away by the wind; the portion consolidated
by pressure being better able to resist the denuding
agency.</p>

<p style="clear: both;">The footprints from the Potsdam sandstone in Canada,
for which the name <i>Protichnites</i> was proposed by
Owen, and which were by him referred to crustaceans
probably resembling <i>Limulus</i>, were shown by the writer,
in 1862,<a name="FNanchor_Q_17" id="FNanchor_Q_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a> to correspond
precisely with those of the
American Limulus (<i>Polyphemus
Occidentalis</i>) (<a href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>).
I proved by experiment
with the modern animal
that the recurring series
of groups of markings
were produced by the toes
of the large posterior thoracic
feet, the irregular
scratches seen in <i>Protichnites
lineatus</i> by the ordinary
feet, and the central furrow by the tail. It was also
shown that when the Limulus uses its swimming-feet it
produces impressions of the character of those named
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">« 29 »</a></span>
<i>Climactichnites</i>, from the same beds which afford <i>Protichnites</i>.
The principal difference between <i>Protichnites</i>
and their modern representatives is that the latter have
two lateral furrows
produced by the
sides of the carapace,
which are
wanting in the former.</p>

applied the same

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">« 31 »</a></span>
of these, and Nathorst has confirmed this conclusion by
elaborate experiments on living animals, that these forms
are really trails impressed on soft

by crustaceans.</p>

in believing that all or nearly all
the forms referred to Crossochorda

allied to Nereites, and due
either to worms or, as Nathorst has
shown to be possible, to small crustaceans.

mere markings.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that these
markings strikingly resemble the so-called
<i>Eophyton</i>, described by Torell
from the Primordial of Sweden, and
by Billings from that of Newfoundland;
and which also occur abundantly
in the Primordial of New
Brunswick. After examining a series
of these markings from Sweden
shown to me by Mr. Carruthers in
London, and also specimens from Newfoundland and
a large number <i>in situ</i> at St. John, I am convinced
that they cannot be plants, but must be markings of
the nature of <i>Rhabdichnites</i>. This conclusion is based
on the absence of carbonaceous matter, the intimate
union of the markings with the surface of the stone,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">« 32 »</a></span>
their indefinite forms, their want of nodes or appendages,
and their markings being always of such a nature
as could be produced by scratches of a sharp
instrument. Since, however, fishes are yet unknown in
beds of this age, they may possibly be referred to the
feet or spinous tails of swimming crustaceans. Salter
has already suggested this origin for some scratches of
somewhat different form found in the Primordial of
Great Britain. He supposed them to have been the
work of species of <i>Hymenocaris</i>. These marks may,
however, indicate the existence of some free-swimming
animals of the Primordial seas as yet unknown
to us.</p>

<p>Three other suggestions merit consideration in this
connection. One is that Algæ and also land-plants, drifting
with tides or currents, often make the most remarkable
and fantastic trails. A marking of this kind has
been observed by Dr. G. M. Dawson to be produced by
a drifted Laminaria, and in complexity it resembled the
extraordinary <i>Ænigmichnus multiformis</i> of Hitchcock
from the Connecticut sandstones. Much more simple
markings of this kind would suffice to give species of
<i>Eophyton</i>. Another is furnished by a fact stated to the
author by Prof. Morse, namely, that Lingulæ, when dislodged
from their burrows, trail themselves over the
bottom like worms, by means of their cirri. Colonies of
these creatures, so abundant in the Primordial, may,
when obliged to remove, have covered the surfaces of
beds of mud with vermicular markings. The third is
that the Rhabdichnite-markings resemble some of the
grooves in Silurian rocks which have been referred to
trails of Gasteropods, as, for instance, those from the
Clinton group, described by Hall.</p>

<p>Another kind of markings not even organic, but altogether
depending on physical causes, are the beautiful
branching rill-marks produced by the oozing of water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">« 33 »</a></span>
out of mud and sand-banks left by the tide, and which
sometimes cover great surfaces with the most elaborate
tracery, on the modern tidal shores as well as in some of
the most ancient rocks. <i>Dendrophycus</i><a name="FNanchor_V_22" id="FNanchor_V_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_22" class="fnanchor">[V]</a> of Lesquereux
seems to be an example of rill-mark, as well as <i>Aristophycus</i>,
<i>Cl&oelig;phycus</i>, and <i>Zygopliycus</i>, of Miller and Dyer,
from the Lower Silurian.</p>

<p>Rill-marks occur in very old rocks,<a name="FNanchor_W_23" id="FNanchor_W_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_W_23" class="fnanchor">[W]</a> but are perhaps

<p><i>Shrinkage-cracks</i> are also abundant
in some of the Carboniferous
beds, and are sometimes accompanied
with impressions of rain-drops.
When finely reticulated
they might be mistaken for the
venation of leaves, and, when
complicated with little rill-marks
tributary to their sides, they precisely
resemble the <i>Dictyolites</i> of
Hall from the Medina sandstone

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 11.&mdash;Cast of shrinkage cracks (Carboniferous,

</div>

<p>An entirely different kind of shrinkage-crack is that
which occurs in certain carbonised and flattened plants,
and which sometimes communicates to them a marvellous
resemblance to the netted under surface of an exogenous
leaf. Flattened stems of plants and layers of cortical
matter, when carbonised, shrink in such a manner as to
produce minute reticulated cracks. These become filled
with mineral matter before the coaly substance has been
completely consolidated. A further compression occurs,
causing the coaly substance to collapse, leaving the little
veins of harder mineral matter projecting. These impress
their form upon the clay or shale above and below,
and thus when the mass is broken open we have a carbonaceous
film or thin layer covered with a network of
raised lines, and
corresponding minute
depressed
lines on the shale
in contact with it.
The reticulations
are generally irregular,
but sometimes
they very
closely resemble
the veins of a reticulately
veined
leaf. One of the
most curious specimens
in my possession
was collected
by Mr. Elder
in the Lower Carboniferous
of Horton Bluff. The little veins which form
the projecting network are in this case white calcite; but
at the surface their projecting edges are blackened with
a carbonaceous film.</p>

<p><i>Slickensided bodies</i>, resembling the fossil fruits described
by Geinitz as <i>Gulielmites</i>, and the objects believed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">« 35 »</a></span>
by Fleming and Carruthers<a name="FNanchor_Y_25" id="FNanchor_Y_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_Y_25" class="fnanchor">[Y]</a> to be casts of cavities filled
with fluid, abound in the shales of the Carboniferous and
Devonian. They are, no doubt, in most cases the results
of the pressure and consolidation of the clay around small
solid bodies, whether organic, fragmentary, or concretionary.
They are, in short, local slickensides precisely
similar to those found so plentifully in the coal under-clays,
and which, as I have elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_Z_26" id="FNanchor_Z_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_Z_26" class="fnanchor">[Z]</a> shown, resulted
from the internal giving way and slipping of the mass as
the roots of Stigmaria decayed within it. Most collectors
of fossil plants in the older formations must, I presume,
be familiar with appearances of this kind in connection
with small stems, petioles, fragments of wood, and carpolites.
I have in my collection petioles of ferns and
fruits of the genus Trigonocarpum partially slickensided
in this way, and which if wholly covered by this kind of
marking could scarcely have been recognised. I have
figured bodies of this kind in my report on the Devonian
and Upper Silurian plants of Canada, believing them,
owing to their carbonaceous covering, to be probably
slickensided fruits, though of uncertain nature. In every
case I think these bodies must have had a solid nucleus of
some sort, as the severe pressure implied in slickensiding
is quite incompatible with a mere &ldquo;fluid-cavity,&rdquo; even
supposing this to have existed.</p>

<p>Prof. Marsh has well explained another phase of the
influence of hard bodies in producing partial slickensides,
in his paper on <i>Stylolites</i>, read before the American Association
in 1867, and the application of the combined
forces of concretionary action and slickensiding to the
production of the cone-in-cone concretions, which occur
in the coal-formation and as low as the Primordial. I
have figured a very perfect and beautiful form of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">« 36 »</a></span>
kind from the coal-formation of Nova Scotia, which is
described in &ldquo;Acadian Geology&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_AA_27" id="FNanchor_AA_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_AA_27" class="fnanchor">[AA]</a> (<a href="#fig12">Fig. 12</a>).</p>

<p>I have referred to these facts here because they are
relatively more important in that older period, which may
be named the age of Algæ, and because their settlement
now will enable us to dispense with discussions of this
kind further on. The able memoirs of Nathorst and
Williamson should be studied by those who desire further
information.</p>

<p>But it may be asked, &ldquo;Are there no real examples of
fossil Algæ?&rdquo; I believe there are many such, but the difficulty
is to distinguish
them. Confining ourselves
to the older
rocks, the following
may be noted:</p>

<p>The genus <i>Buthotrephis</i>
of Hall,
which is characterised
as having stems, sub-cylindric
or compressed,
with numerous
branches, which
are divaricating and
sometimes leaf-like,
contains some true Algæ. Hall&rsquo;s <i>B. gracilis</i>, from the
Siluro-Cambrian, is one of these. Similar plants, referred
to the same species, occur in the Clinton and Niagara
formations, and a beautiful species, collected by Col.
Grant, of Hamilton, and now in the McGill College collection,
represents a broader and more frondose type of
distinctly carbonaceous character. It may be described
as follows:</p>

<p><i>Buthotrephis Grantii</i>, S. N. (<a href="#fig13">Fig. 13</a>).&mdash;Stems and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">« 37 »</a></span>
fronds smooth and slightly striate longitudinally, with
curved and interrupted striæ. Stem thick, bifurcating,
the divisions terminating in irregularly pinnate fronds,
apparently truncate at the extremities. The quantity
of carbonaceous
matter present
would indicate
thick, though perhaps
flattened,
stems and dense
fleshy fronds.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 305px;">
<a id="fig13" name="fig13"></a>
<img src="images/fig13.png" width="305" height="558" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 13.&mdash;<i>Buthotrephis Grantii</i>, a genuine Alga
from the Silurian, Canada.</div>
</div>

<p>The species
<i>Buthotrephis subnodosa</i>
and <i>B.
flexuosa</i>, from
the Utica shale,
are also certainly
plants, though
it is possible, if
their structures
and fruit were
known, some of
these might be
referred to different
genera. All
of these plants
have either carbonaceous
matter
or produce organic
stains on the
matrix.</p>

<p>The organism
with diverging
wedge-shaped fronds, described by Hall as <i>Sphenothallus
angustifolius</i>, is also a plant. Fine specimens, in the
collection of the Geological Survey of Canada, show distinct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">« 38 »</a></span>
evidence of the organic character of the wedge-shaped
fronds. It is from the Utica shale, and elsewhere
in the Siluro-Cambrian. It is just possible, as suggested
by Hall, that this plant may be of higher rank than the
Algæ.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Palæophycus</i> of Hall includes a great variety
of uncertain objects, of which only a few are probably
true Algæ. I have specimens of fragments similar
to his <i>P. virgatus</i>, which show distinct carbonaceous
films, and others from the Quebec group, which seem to
be cylindrical tubes now flattened, and which have contained
spindle-shaped sporangia of large size. Tortuous
and curved flattened stems, or fronds, from the Upper
Silurian limestone of Gaspé, also show organic matter.</p>

<p>Respecting the forms referred to <i>Licrophycus</i> by
Billings, containing stems or semi-cylindrical markings
springing from a common base, I have been in great
doubt. I have not seen any specimens containing unequivocal
organic matter, and am inclined to think that
most of them, if not the whole, are casts of worm-burrows,
with trails radiating from them.</p>

<p>Though I have confined myself in this notice to plants,
or supposed plants, of the Lower Palæozoic, it may be
well to mention the remarkable Cauda-Galli fucoids, referred
by Hall to the genus <i>Spirophyton</i>, and which are
characteristic of the oldest Erian beds. The specimens
which I have seen from New York, from Gaspé, and
from Brazil, leave no doubt in my mind that these were
really marine plants, and that the form of a spiral frond,
assigned to them by Hall, is perfectly correct. They
must have been very abundant and very graceful plants
of the early Erian, immediately after the close of the
Silurian period.</p>

<p>We come now to notice certain organisms referred to
Algæ, and which are either of animal origin, or are of
higher grade than the sea-weeds. We have already discussed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">« 39 »</a></span>
the questions relating to <i>Prototaxites</i>. <i>Drepanophycus</i>,
of Goeppert,<a name="FNanchor_AB_28" id="FNanchor_AB_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_AB_28" class="fnanchor">[AB]</a> I suspect, is only a badly preserved
branch or stem of the Erian land-plant known as Arthrostigma.
In like manner, <i>Haliserites Dechenianus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_AC_29" id="FNanchor_AC_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_AC_29" class="fnanchor">[AC]</a> of
Goeppert, is evidently the land-plant known as <i>Psilophyton</i>.
<i>Sphærococcites dentatus</i> and <i>S. serra</i>&mdash;the <i>Fucoides
dentatus</i> and <i>serra</i> of Brongniart, from Quebec&mdash;are
graptolites of two species quite common there.<a name="FNanchor_AD_30" id="FNanchor_AD_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_AD_30" class="fnanchor">[AD]</a> <i>Dictyophyton</i>
and <i>Uphantenia</i>, as described by Hall and the
author, are now known to be sponges. They have become
<i>Dictyospongiæ</i>. The curious and very ancient; fossils
referred by Forbes to the genus <i>Oldhamia</i> are perhaps
still subject to doubt, but are usually regarded as Zoöphytes,
though it is quite possible they may be plants.
Though I have not seen the specimens, I have no doubt
whatever that the plants, or the greater part of them,
from the Silurian of Bohemia, described by Stur as Algæ
and Characeæ,<a name="FNanchor_AE_31" id="FNanchor_AE_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_AE_31" class="fnanchor">[AE]</a> are really land-plants, some of them of
the genus <i>Psilophyton</i>. I may say in this connection
that specimens of flattened <i>Psilophyton</i> and <i>Arthrostigma</i>,
in the Upper Silurian and Erian of Gaspé, would
probably have been referred to Algæ, but for the fact that
in some of them the axis of barred vessels is preserved.</p>

<i>Arthrostigma</i>, and perhaps leafy branches of <i>Berwynia</i>. These
curious plants should be re-examined.</p></div>

<p>It is not surprising that great difficulties have occurred
in the determination of fossil Algæ. Enough, however,
remains certain to prove that the old Cambrian and Silurian
seas were tenanted with sea-weeds not very dissimilar
from those of the present time. It is further probable
that some of the graphitic, carbonaceous, and bituminous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">« 40 »</a></span>
shales and limestones of the Silurian owe their carbonaceous
matters to the decomposition of Algæ, though possibly
some of it may have been derived from Graptolites
and other corneous Zoöphytes. In any case, such microscopic
examinations of these shales as I have made, have
not produced any evidence of the existence of plants of
higher grade, while those of the Erian and Carboniferous
periods, similar to the naked eye, abound in such evidence.
It is also to be observed that, on the surfaces of
beds of sandstone in the Upper Cambrian, carbonaceous
<i>débris</i>, which seems to be the remains of either aquatic
or land plants, is locally not infrequent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">« 41 »</a></span></p>

<p>Referring to the land vegetation of the older rocks, it
is difficult to picture its nature and appearance. We
may imagine the shallow waters filled with aquatic or amphibious
Rhizocarpean plants, vast meadows or brakes of
the delicate <i>Psilophyton</i> and the starry <i>Protannularia</i>
and some tall trees, perhaps looking like gigantic club-mosses,
or possibly with broad, flabby leaves, mostly cellular
in texture, and resembling Algæ transferred to the air.
Imagination can, however, scarcely realise this strange
and grotesque vegetation, which, though possibly copious
and luxuriant, must have been simple and monotonous in
aspect, and, though it must have produced spores and
seeds and even fruits, these were probably all of the types
seen in the modern acrogens and gymnosperms.</p>

<p class="p0">
&ldquo;In garments green, indistinct in the twilight,<br />
They stand like Druids of old, with voices sad and prophetic.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>Prophetic they truly were, as we shall find, of the
more varied forests of succeeding times, and they may
also help us to realise the aspect of that still older vegetation,
which is fossilised in the Laurentian graphite;
though it is not impossible that this last may have been of
higher and more varied types, and that the Cambrian and
Silurian may have been times of depression in the vegetable
world, as they certainly were in the submergence of
much of the land.</p>

<p>These primeval woods served at least to clothe the
nakedness of the new-born land, and they may have sheltered
and nourished forms of land-life still unknown to
us, as we find as yet only a few insects and scorpions in
the Silurian. They possibly also served to abstract from
the atmosphere some portion of its superabundant carbonic
acid harmful to animal life, and they stored up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">« 42 »</a></span>
supplies of graphite, of petroleum, and of illuminating
gas, useful to man at the present day. We may write
of them and draw their forms with, the carbon which
they themselves supplied.</p>

<p class="caption3">NOTE TO CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Examination of Prototaxites</span> (<i>Nematophyton</i>), <span class="smcap">by Prof. Penhallow,
of McGill University.</span></p>

<p>Prof. Penhallow, having kindly consented to re-examine my
specimens, has furnished me with elaborate notes of his facts and
conclusions, of which the following is a summary, but which it is
hoped will be published in full:</p>

<p>"1. <i>Concentric Layers.</i>&mdash;The inner face of each of these is composed
of relatively large tubes, having diameters from 13&middot;6 to 34&middot;6
micro-millimetres. The outer face has tubes ranging from 13&middot;8 to
27&middot;6 mm. The average diameter in the lower surface approaches to 34,
that in the outer to 13&middot;8. There is, however, no abrupt termination
to the surface of the layers, though in some specimens they separate
easily, with shining surfaces.</p>

<p>"2. <i>Minute Structure.</i>&mdash;In longitudinal sections the principal
part of the structure consists of longitudinal tubes of indeterminate
length, and round in cross-section. They are approximately parallel,
but in some cases may be seen to bend sinuously, and are not in
direct contact. Finer myceloid tubes, 5&middot;33 mm. in diameter, traverse
the structure in all directions, and are believed to branch off
from the larger tubes. In a small specimen supposed to be a branch
or small stem, and in which the vertical tubes are somewhat distant
from one another, this horizontal system is very largely developed;
but is less manifest in the older stems. The tubes themselves show
no structure. The ray-like openings in the substance of the tissue
are evidently original parts of the structure, but not of the nature of
medullary rays. They are radiating spaces running outward in an
interrupted manner or so tortuously that they appear to be interrupted
in their course from the centre towards the surface. They
show tubes turning into them, branching into them, and approximately
horizontal, but tortuous. On the external surface of some
specimens these radial spaces are represented by minute pits irregularly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">« 43 »</a></span>
or spirally arranged. The transverse swellings of the stem
show no difference of structure, except that the tubes or cells may be
a little more tortuous, and a transverse film of coaly matter extends
from the outer coaly envelope inwardly. This may perhaps be
caused by some accident of preservation. The outer coaly layer
shows tubes similar to those of the stem.<a name="FNanchor_AF_32" id="FNanchor_AF_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_AF_32" class="fnanchor">[AF]</a> The horizontal or oblique
flexures of the large tubes seem to be mainly in the vicinity of the
radial openings, and it is in entering these that they have been seen
to branch."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_AF_32" id="Footnote_AF_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AF_32"><span class="label">[AF]</span></a> It is possible that these tubes may be merely part of the stem attached
to the bark, which seems to me to indicate the same dense cellular
structure seen in the bark of <i>Lepidodendra</i>, etc.</p></div>

<p>The conclusions arrived at by Prof. Penhallow are as follows:</p>

<p>"1. The plant was not truly exogenous, and the appearance of
rings is independent of the causes which determine the layers of
growth in exogenous plants.</p>

<p>"2. The plant was possessed of no true bark. Whatever cortical
layer was present was in all probability a modification of the general
structure,<a name="FNanchor_AG_33" id="FNanchor_AG_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_AG_33" class="fnanchor">[AG]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_AG_33" id="Footnote_AG_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AG_33"><span class="label">[AG]</span></a> On these points I would reserve the considerations: 1. That there
must have been some relation between the mode of growth of these great
stems and their concentric rings; and, 2. That the evidence of a bark is
as strong as in the case of any Palæozoic tree in which the bark is, as
usual, carbonised.</p></div>

<p>"3. An intimate relation exists between the large tubular cells
and the myceloid filaments, the latter being a system of small
branches from the former; the branching being determined chiefly in
certain special openings which simulate medullary rays.</p>

<p>"4. The specimens examined exhibit no evidence of special decay,
and the structure throughout is of a normal character.</p>

<p>"5. The primary structure consists of large tubular cells without
apparent terminations, and devoid of structural markings, with
which is associated a secondary structure of myceloid filaments arising
from the former.</p>

<p>"6. The structure of <i>Nematophyton</i> as a whole is unique; at least
there is no plant of modern type with which it is comparable.
Nevertheless, the loose character of the entire structure; the interminable
cells; their interlacing; and, finally, their branching into a
secondary series of smaller filaments, point with considerable force to
the true relationship of the stem as being with Algæ or other Thallophytes
rather than with Grymnosperms. A more recent examination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">« 44 »</a></span>
of a laminated resinous substance found associated with the plant
shows that it is wholly amorphous, and, as indicated by distinct lines
of flow, that it must have been in a plastic state at a former period.
The only evidence of structure was found in certain well-defined
mycelia, which may have been derived from associated vegetable
matter upon which they were growing, and over which the plastic
matrix flowed."</p>

<p>I have only to add to this description that when we consider that
<i>Nematophyton Logani</i> was a large tree, sometimes attaining a diameter
of more than two feet, and a stature of at least twenty before
branching; that it had great roots, and gave off large branches; that
it was an aërial plant, probably flourishing in the same swampy flats
with <i>Psilophyton</i>, <i>Arthrostigma</i>, and <i>Leptophleum</i>; that the peculiar
bodies known as Pachytheca were not unlikely its fruit&mdash;we have
evidence that there were, in the early Palæozoic period, plants
scarcely dreamt of by modern botany. Only when the appendages
of these plants are more fully known can we hope to understand
them. In the mean time, I may state that there were probably different
species of these trees, indicated more particularly by the stems I
have described as <i>Nematoxylon</i> and <i>Celluloxylon</i><a name="FNanchor_AH_34" id="FNanchor_AH_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_AH_34" class="fnanchor">[AH]</a> There were, I
think, some indications that the plants described by Carruthers as
<i>Berwynia</i>, may also be found to have been generically the same.
The resinous matter mentioned by Prof. Penhallow is found in great
abundance in the beds containing <i>Nematophyton</i>, and must, I think,
have been an exudation from its bark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the last chapter we were occupied with the comparatively
few and obscure remains of plants entombed
in the oldest geological formations. We now ascend to a
higher plane, that of the Erian or Devonian period, in
which, for the first time, we find varied and widely distributed
forests.</p>

<p>The growth of knowledge with respect to this flora
has been somewhat rapid, and it may be interesting to
note its principal stages, as an encouragement to the hope
that we may yet learn something more satisfactory respecting
the older floras we have just discussed.</p>

<p>In Goeppert&rsquo;s memoir on the flora of the Silurian,
Devonian, and Lower Carboniferous rocks, published in
1860,<a name="FNanchor_AI_35" id="FNanchor_AI_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_AI_35" class="fnanchor">[AI]</a> he enumerates twenty species as Silurian, but these
are all admitted to be Algæ, and several of them are remains
which may be fairly claimed by the zoologists as
zoophytes, or trails of worms and mollusks. In the Lower
Devonian he knows but six species, five of which are
Algæ, and the remaining one a <i>Sigillaria</i>, but this is of
very doubtful nature. In the Middle Devonian he gives
but one species, a land-plant of the genus <i>Lepidodendron</i>.
In the Upper Devonian the number rises to fifty-seven,
of which all but seven are terrestrial plants, representing
a large number of the genera occurring in the succeeding

<p>Goeppert does not include in his enumeration the
plants from the Devonian of Gaspé, described by the
author in 1859,<a name="FNanchor_AJ_36" id="FNanchor_AJ_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_AJ_36" class="fnanchor">[AJ]</a> having seen only an abstract of the
paper at the time of writing his memoir, nor does he
appear to have any knowledge of the plants of this age
described by Lesquereux in Roger&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pennsylvania.&rdquo;
These might have added ten or twelve species to his list,
some of them probably from the Lower Devonian. It is
further to be observed that a few additional species had
also been recognised by Peach in the Old Red Sandstone
of Scotland.</p>

<p>But from 1860 to the present time a rich harvest of
specimens has been gathered from the Gaspé sandstones,
from the shales of southern New Brunswick, from the
sandstones of Perry in Maine, and from the wide-spread
Erian areas of New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio.
Nearly all these specimens have passed through my
hands, and I am now able to catalogue about a hundred
species, representing more than thirty genera, and
including all the great types of vascular Cryptogams, the
Gymnosperms, and even one (still doubtful) Angiosperm.
Many new forms have also been described from the Devonian
of Scotland and of the Continent of Europe.</p>

<p>Before describing these plants in detail, we may refer
to North America for illustration of the physical conditions
of the time. In a physical point of view the northern
hemisphere presented a great change in the Erian
period. There were vast foldings of the crust of the
earth, and great emissions of volcanic rock on both sides
of the Atlantic. In North America, while at one time
the whole interior area of the continent, as far north as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">« 47 »</a></span>
the Great Lakes, was occupied by a vast inland sea, studded
with coral islands, the long Appalachian ridge had begun
to assume, along with the old Laurentian land, something
of the form of our present continent, and on the margins
of this Appalachian belt there were wide, swampy flats and
shallow-water areas, which, under the mild climate that
seems to have characterised this period, were admirably
suited to nourish a luxuriant vegetation. Under this
mild climate, also, it would seem that new forms of plants
were first introduced in the far north, where the long
continuance of summer sunlight, along with great warm th,
seems to have aided in their introduction and early extension,
and thence made their way to the southward, a
process which, as Gray and others have shown, has also
occurred in later geological times.</p>

<p>The America of this Erian age consisted during the
greater part of the period of a more or less extensive belt
of land in the north with two long tongues descending
from it, one along the Appalachian line in the east, the
other in the region west of the Rocky Mountains. On
the seaward sides of these there were low lands covered
with vegetation, while on the inland side the great interior
sea, with its verdant and wooded islands, realised,
though probably with shallower water, the conditions of
the modern archipelagoes of the Pacific.</p>

<p>Europe presented conditions somewhat similar, having
in the earlier and middle portions of the period great sea
areas with insular patches of land, and later wide tracts
of shallow and in part enclosed water areas, swarming
with fishes, and having an abundant vegetation on their
shores. These were the conditions of the Eifel and
Devonshire limestones, and of the Old Red Sandstone of
Scotland, and the Kiltorcan beds of Ireland. In Europe
also, as in America, there were in the Erian age great
ejections of igneous rock. On both sides of the Atlantic
there were somewhat varied and changing conditions of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">« 48 »</a></span>
land and water, and a mild and equable climate, permitting
the existence of a rich vegetation in high northern
latitudes. Of this latter fact a remarkable example is
afforded by the beds holding plants of this age in Spitzbergen
and Bear Island, in its vicinity. Here there seem
to be two series of plant-bearing strata, one with the
vegetation of the Upper Erian, the other with that of
the Lower Carboniferous, though both have been united
by Heer under his so-called &ldquo;Ursa Stage&rdquo; in which he
has grouped the characteristic plants of two distinct
periods. This has recently been fully established by the
researches of Nathorst, though the author had already
suggested it as the probable explanation of the strange
union of species in the Ursa group of Heer.</p>

<p>In studying the vegetation of this remarkable period,
we must take merely some of the more important forms
as examples, since it would be impossible to notice all
the species, and some of them may be better treated in
the Carboniferous, where they have their headquarters.
(<a href="#fig15">Fig. 15.</a>)</p>

<p>I may first refer to a family which seems to have culminated
in the Erian age, and ever since to have occupied
a less important place. It is that of the curious aquatic
plants known as Rhizocarps,<a name="FNanchor_AK_37" id="FNanchor_AK_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_AK_37" class="fnanchor">[AK]</a> and referred to in the last
chapter.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_AK_37" id="Footnote_AK_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AK_37"><span class="label">[AK]</span></a> Or, as they have recently been named by some botanists, &ldquo;Heterosporous
Filices,&rdquo; though they are certainly not ferns in any ordinary
sense of that term.</p></div>

<p>My attention was first directed to these organisms by
the late Sir W. E. Logan in 1869. He had obtained from
the Upper Erian shale of Kettle Point, Lake Huron,
specimens filled with minute circular discs, to which he
referred, in his report of 1863, as &ldquo;microscopic orbicular
bodies.&rdquo; Recognising them to be macrospores, or spore-cases,
I introduced them into the report on the Erian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">« 49 »</a></span>
flora, which I was then preparing, and which was published
in 1871, under the name <i>Sporangites Huronensis</i>.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 404px;">

<i>Leptophleum</i>, <i>Lepidodendron</i>, <i>Cordaites</i>, <i>Sigillaria</i>, <i>Dadoxylon</i>,
<i>Asterophyllites</i>, <i>Platyphyllum</i>.</div>
</div>

<p>In 1871, having occasion to write a communication to
the &ldquo;American Journal of Science&rdquo; on the question then
raised as to the share of spores and spore-cases in the accumulation
of coal, a question to be discussed in a subsequent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">« 50 »</a></span>
chapter, these curious little bodies were again
reviewed, and were described in substance as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The oldest bed of spore-cases known to me is that
at Kettle Point, Lake Huron. It is a bed of brown
bituminous shale, burning with much flame, and under
a lens is seen to be studded with flattened disc-like bodies,
scarcely more than a hundredth of an inch in diameter,
which under the microscope are found to be spore-cases
(or macrospores) slightly papillate externally (or more
properly marked with dark pores), and sometimes showing
a point of attachment on one side and a slit more or
less elongated and gaping on the other. When slices of
the rock are made, its substance is seen to be filled with
these bodies, which, viewed as transparent objects, appear
yellow like amber, and show little structure, except that
the walls can be distinguished from the internal cavity,
which may sometimes be seen to enclose patches of granular
matter. In the shale containing them are also vast
numbers of rounded, translucent granules, which may be
escaped spores (microspores).&rdquo; The bed containing these
spores at Kettle Point was stated, in the reports of the
&ldquo;Geological Survey of Canada,&rdquo; to be twelve or fourteen
feet in thickness, and besides these specimens it contained
fossil plants referable to the species <i>Calamites inornatus</i>
and <i>Lepidodendron primævum</i>, and I not unnaturally
supposed that the Sporangites might be the fruit of the
latter plant. I also noticed their resemblance to the
spore-cases of <i>L. corrugatum</i> of the Lower Carboniferous
(a Lepidodendron allied to <i>L. primævum</i>), and to those
from Brazil described by Carruthers under the name
<i>Flemingites</i>, as well as to those described by Huxley
from certain English coals, and to those of the Tasmanite
or white coal of Australia. The bed at Kettle Point is
shown to be marine by its holding the sea-weed known
as <i>Spirophyton</i>, and shells of <i>Lingula</i>.</p>

<p>The subject did not again come under my notice till
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">« 51 »</a></span>
1882, when Prof. Orton, of Columbus, Ohio, sent me
some specimens from the Erian shales of that State,
which on comparison seemed undistinguishable from
<i>Sporangites Huronensis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_AL_38" id="FNanchor_AL_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_AL_38" class="fnanchor">[AL]</a> Prof. Orton read an interesting
paper on these bodies, at the meeting of the American
Association in Montreal, in which were some new and
striking facts. One of these was the occurrence of such
bodies throughout the black shales of Ohio, extending
&ldquo;from the Huron River, on the shore of Lake Brie, to
the mouth of the Scioto, in the Ohio Valley, with an
extent varying from ten to twenty miles in breadth,&rdquo; and
estimated to be three hundred and fifty feet in thickness.
I have since been informed by my friend Mr. Thomas, of
Chicago, that its thickness, in some places at least, must
be three times that amount. About the same time. Prof.
Williams, of Cornell, and Prof. Clarke, of Northampton,
announced similar discoveries in the State of New York,
so that it would appear that beds of vast area and of great
thickness are replete with these little vegetable discs, usually
converted into a highly bituminous, amber-like substance,
giving a more or less inflammable character to the
containing rock.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_AL_38" id="Footnote_AL_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AL_38"><span class="label">[AL]</span></a> These shales have been described, as to their chemical and geological
relations, by Dr. T. Sterry Hunt, &ldquo;American Journal of Science,&rdquo; 1863,
and by Dr. Newberry, in the &ldquo;Reports of the Geological Survey of Ohio,&rdquo;
vol. i., 1863, and vol. iii., 1878.</p></div>

<p>Another fact insisted on by Prof. Orton was the absence
of Lepidodendroid cones, and the occurrence of
filamentous vegetable matter, to which the Sporangites
seemed to be in some cases attached in groups. Prof.
Orton also noticed the absence of the trigonal form, which
belongs to the spores of many Lepidodendra, though this
is not a constant character. In the discussion on Prof.
Orton&rsquo;s paper, I admitted that the facts detailed by him
shook my previous belief of the lycopodiaceous character
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">« 52 »</a></span>
of these bodies, and induced me to suspect, with Prof.
Orton, that they might have belonged to some group of
aquatic plants lower than the Lycopods.</p>

<p>Since the publication of my paper on Rhizocarps in
the Palæozoic period above referred to, I have received
two papers from Mr. Edward Wethered, F. G. S., in one
of which he describes spores of plants found in the lower
limestone shales of the Forest of Dean, and in the other
discusses more generally the structure and origin of Carboniferous
coal-beds.<a name="FNanchor_AM_39" id="FNanchor_AM_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_AM_39" class="fnanchor">[AM]</a> In both papers he refers to the
occurrence in these coals and shales of organisms essentially
similar to the Erian spores.</p>

Royal Microscopical Society,&rdquo; 1885.</p></div>

<p>In the &ldquo;Bulletin of the Chicago Academy of Science,&rdquo;
January, 1884, Dr. Johnson and Mr. Thomas, in their
paper on the &ldquo;Microscopic Organisms of the Boulder Clay
of Chicago and Vicinity,&rdquo; notice <i>Sporangites Huronensis</i>
as among these organisms, and have discovered them also
in large numbers in the precipitate from Chicago city
water-supply. They refer them to the decomposition of
the Erian shales, of which boulders filled with these organisms
are of frequent occurrence in the Chicago clays.
The Sporangites and their accompaniments in the boulder
clay are noticed in a paper by Dr. G. M. Dawson, in the
&ldquo;Bulletin of the Chicago Academy,&rdquo; June, 1885.</p>

<p>Prof. Clarke has also described, in the &ldquo;American
Journal of Science&rdquo; for April, 1885, the forms already
alluded to, and which he finds to consist of macrospores
enclosed in sporocarps. He compares these with my
<i>Sporangites Huronensis</i> and <i>Protosalvinia bilobata</i>, but
I think it is likely that one of them at least is a distinct
species.</p>

<p>I may add that in the &ldquo;Geological Magazine&rdquo; for
1875, Mr. Newton, F. G. S., of the Geological Survey of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">« 53 »</a></span>
England, published a description of the Tasmanite and
Australian white coal, in which he shows that the organisms
in these deposits are similar to my <i>Sporangites
Huronensis</i>, and to the macrospores previously described
by Prof. Huxley, from the Better-bed coal. Mr. Newton
does not seem to have been aware of my previous description
of <i>Sporangites</i>, and proposes the name <i>Tasmanites
punctatus</i> for the Australian form.</p>

<p>Here we have the remarkable fact that the waste
macrospores, or larger spores of a species of Cryptogamous
plant, occur dispersed in countless millions of tons
through the shales of the Erian in Canada and the United
States.</p>

<p>No certain clue seemed to be afforded by all these
observations as to the precise affinities of these widely
distributed bodies; but this was furnished shortly after
from an unexpected quarter. In March, 1883, Mr. Orville
Derby, of the Geological Survey of Brazil, sent me
specimens found in the Erian of that country, which
seemed to throw a new light on the whole subject. These
I described and pointed out their connection with <i>Sporangites</i>
at the meeting of the American Association at Minneapolis,
in 1883, and subsequently published my notes
respecting them in its proceedings, and in the &ldquo;Canadian
Record of Science.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Derby&rsquo;s specimens contained the curious spiral
sea-weed known as <i>Spirophyton</i>, and also minute rounded
Sporangites like those obtained in the Erian of Ohio, and
of which specimens had been sent to me some years before
by the late Prof. Hartt. But they differed in showing
the remarkable fact that these rounded bodies are
enclosed in considerable numbers in spherical and oval
sacs, the walls of which are composed of a tissue of
hexagonal cells, and which resemble in every respect the
involucres or spore-sacs of the little group of modern
acrogens known as Rhizocarps, and living in shallow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">« 54 »</a></span>
water. More especially they resemble the sporocarps of
the genus <i>Salvinia</i>. This fact opened up an entirely
new field of investigation, and I at once proceeded to
compare the specimens with the fructification of modern
Rhizocarps, and found that substantially these multitudinous
spores embedded in the Erie shales may be regarded
as perfectly analogous to the larger spores of the
modern <i>Salvinia natans</i> of Europe, as may be seen by
the representation of them in <a href="#fig16">Fig. 16</a>.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 394px;">

</div>

<p>The typical macrospores from the Erian shales are
perfectly circular in outline, and in the flattened state appear
as discs with rounded edges, their ordinary diameter
being from one seventy-fifth to one one-hundredth of an
inch, though they vary considerably in size. This, however,
I do not regard as an essential character. The
edges, as seen in profile, are smooth, but the flat surface
often presents minute dark spots, which at first I mistook
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">« 55 »</a></span>
for papillæ, but now agree with Mr. Thomas in recognising
them as minute pores traversing the wall of the
disc, and similar to those which Mr. Newton has described
in Tasmanite, and which Mr. Wethered has also recognised
in the similar spores of the Forest of Dean shales.
The walls also sometimes show faint indications of concentric
lamination, as if they had been thickened by successive
deposits.</p>

<p>As seen by transmitted light, and either in front or in
profile, the discs are of a rich amber colour, translucent
and structureless, except the pores above referred to.
The walls are somewhat thick, or from one-tenth to one-twentieth
the diameter of the disc in thickness. They
never exhibit the triradiate marking seen in spores of Lycopods,
nor any definite point of attachment, though
they sometimes show a minute elongated spot which may
be of this nature, and they are occasionally seen to have
opened by slits on the edge or front, where there would
seem to have been a natural line of dehiscence. The interior
is usually quite vacant or structureless, but in some
cases there are curved internal markings which may indicate
a shrunken lining membrane, or the remains of a
prothallus or embryo. Occasionally a fine granular substance
appears in the interior, possibly remains of microspores.</p>

<p>The discs are usually detached and destitute of any
envelope, but fragments of flocculent cellular matter are
associated with them, and in one specimen from the corniferous
limestone of Ohio, in Mr. Thomas&rsquo;s collection, I
have found a group of eight or more discs partly enclosed
in a cellular sac-like membrane of similar character to
that enclosing the Brazilian specimens already referred to.</p>

<p>The characters of all the specimens are essentially
similar, and there is a remarkable absence of other organisms
in the shale. In one instance only, I have observed
a somewhat smaller round body with a dark centre or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">« 56 »</a></span>
nucleus, and a wide translucent margin, marked by a
slight granulation. Even this, however, may indicate
nothing more than a different state of preservation.</p>

<p>It is proper to observe here that the wall or enclosing
sac of these macrospores must have been of very dense
consistency, and now appears as a highly bituminous substance,
in this agreeing with that of the spores of Lycopods,
and, like them, having been when recent of a highly
carbonaceous and hydrogenous quality, very combustible
and readily admitting of change into bituminous matter.
In the paper already referred to, on spore-cases in coals,
I have noticed that the relative composition of lycopodium
and cellulose is as follows:</p>

<table summary="formulae">
<tr>
  <td class="vtop larger">Cellulose,</td>
  <td class="tdl larger">C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>20</sub>O<sub>20</sub>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="vtop larger">Lycopodium,</td>
  <td class="tdl larger">C<sub>42</sub>H<sub>19<sup>4</sup>/<sub>12</sub></sub>NO<sub>5<sup>6</sup>/<sub>10</sub></sub>.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Thus, such spores are admirably suited for the production
of highly carbonaceous or bituminous coals, etc.</p>

<p>Nothing is more remarkable in connection with these
bodies than their uniformity of structure and form over
so great areas and throughout so great thickness of rock,
and the absence of any other kind of spore-case. This
is more especially noteworthy in contrast with the coarse
coals and bituminous shales of the Carboniferous, which
usually contain a great variety of spores and sporangia,
indicating the presence of many species of acrogenous
plants, while the Erian shales, on the contrary, indicate the
almost exclusive predominance of one form. This contrast
is well seen in the Bedford shales overlying these
beds, and I believe Lower Carboniferous.<a name="FNanchor_AN_40" id="FNanchor_AN_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_AN_40" class="fnanchor">[AN]</a> Specimens of
these have been kindly communicated to me by Prof.
Orton, and have been prepared by Mr. Thomas. In these
we see the familiar Carboniferous spores with triradiate
markings called <i>Triletes</i> by Reinsch, and which are similar
to those of Lycopodiaceous plants. Still more abundant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">« 57 »</a></span>
are those spinous and hooked spores or sporangia,
to which the names <i>Sporocarpon</i>, <i>Zygosporites</i>, and <i>Traquaria</i>
have been given, and some of which Williamson
has shown to be spores of Lycopodiaceous plants.<a name="FNanchor_AO_41" id="FNanchor_AO_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_AO_41" class="fnanchor">[AO]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_AN_40" id="Footnote_AN_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AN_40"><span class="label">[AN]</span></a> According to Newberry, lower part of Waverly group.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_AO_41" id="Footnote_AO_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AO_41"><span class="label">[AO]</span></a> <i>Traquaria</i> is to be distinguished from the calcareous bodies found
in the corniferous limestone of Kelly&rsquo;s Island, which I have described in
the &ldquo;Canadian Naturalist&rdquo; as <i>Saccamina Eriana</i>, and believe to be Foraminiferal
tests. They have since been described by Ulrich under a
different name (<i>Moellerina</i>: contribution to &ldquo;American Palæontology,&rdquo;
1886). See Dr. Williamson&rsquo;s papers in &ldquo;Transactions of Royal Society
of London.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The true &ldquo;Sporangites,&rdquo; on the contrary, are round
and smooth, with thick bituminous walls, which are
punctured with minute transverse pores. In these respects,
as already stated, they closely resemble the bodies
found in the Australian white coal and Tasmanite. The
precise geological age of this last material is not known
with certainty, but it is believed to be Palæozoic.</p>

<p>With reference to the mode of occurrence of these
bodies, we may note first their great abundance and wide
distribution. The horizontal range of the bed at Kettle
Point is not certainly known, but it is merely a northern
outlier of the great belt of Erian shales referred to by
Prof. Orton, and which extends, with a breadth of ten to
twenty miles, and of great thickness, across the State of
Ohio, for nearly two hundred miles. This Ohio black
shale, which lies at the top of the Erian or the base of
the Carboniferous, though probably mainly of Erian age,
appears to abound throughout in these organisms, and in
some beds to be replete with them. In like manner, in
Brazil, according to Mr. Derby, these organisms are distributed
over a wide area and throughout a great thickness
of shale holding <i>Spirophyton</i>, and apparently belonging
to the Upper Erian. The recurrence of similar forms
in the Tasmanite and white coal of Tasmania and Australia
is another important fact of distribution. To this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">« 58 »</a></span>
we may add the appearance of these macrospores in coals
and shales of the Carboniferous period, though there in
association with other forms.</p>

<p>It is also to be observed that the Erian shales, and the
Forest of Dean beds described by Wethered, are marine,
as shown by their contained fossils; and, though I have
no certain information as to the Tasmanite and Australian
white coal, they would seem, from the description of
Milligan, to occur in distinctly aqueous, possibly estuarine,
deposits. Wethered has shown that the discs described
by Huxley and Newton in the Better-bed coal
occur in the earthy or fragmentary layers, as distinguished
from the pure coal. Those occurring in cannel
coal are in the same case, so that the general mode of
occurrence implies water-driftage, since, in the case of
bodies so large and dense, wind-driftage to great distances
would be impossible.</p>

<p>These facts, taken in connection with the differences
between these macrospores and those of any known land-plant
of the Palæozoic, would lead to the inference that
they belonged to aquatic plants, and these vastly abundant
in the waters of the Erian and Carboniferous periods.</p>

<p>It is still further to be observed that they are not, in
the Erian beds, accompanied with any remains of woody
or scalariform tissues, such as might be expected in connection
with the <i>débris</i> of terrestrial acrogens, and that,
on the other hand, we find them enclosed in cellular
sporocarps, though in the majority of cases these have
been removed by dehiscence or decay.</p>

<p>These considerations, I think, all point to the probability
which I have suggested in my papers on this subject
referred to above, that we have in these objects the
organs of fructification of plants belonging to the order
<i>Rhizocarpeæ</i>, or akin to it. The comparisons which I
have instituted with the sporocarps and macrospores of
these plants confirm this suggestion. Of the modern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">« 59 »</a></span>
species which I have had an opportunity to examine,
<i>Salvinia natans</i> of Europe perhaps presents the closest
resemblance. In this plant groups of round cellular
sporocarps appear at the bases of the floating fronds.
They are about a line in diameter when mature, and are
of two kinds, one containing macrospores, the other microspores
or antheridia. The first, when mature, hold a
number of closely packed globular or oval sporangia of
loose cellular tissue, attached to a central placenta. Each
of these sporangia contains a single macrospore, perfectly
globular and smooth, with a dense outer membrane (exhibiting
traces of lamination, and showing within an
irregularly vacuolated or cellular structure, probably a
prothallus). I cannot detect in it the peculiar pores
which appear in the fossil specimens. Each macrospore
is about one-seventieth of an inch in diameter when mature.
The sporocarps of the microspores contain a vastly
greater number of minute sporangia, about one two-hundredths
of an inch in diameter. These contain disc-like
antheridia, or microspores of very minute size.</p>

<p>The discs from Kettle Point and from the Ohio black
shale, and from the shale boulders of the Chicago clays,
are similar to the macrospores of <i>Salvinia</i>, except that
they have a thicker wall and are a little less in diameter,
being about one-eightieth of an inch. The Brazilian
sporocarps are considerably larger than those of the modern
<i>Salvinia</i>, and the macrospores approach in size to
those of the modern species, being one seventy-fifth of an
inch in diameter. They also seem, like the modern species,
to have thinner walls than those from Canada, Ohio,
and Chicago. No distinct indication has been observed
in the fossil species of the inner Sporangium of <i>Salvinia</i>.
Possibly it was altogether absent, but more probably it is
not preserved as a distinct structure.</p>

<p>With reference to the microspores of <i>Salvinia</i>, it is to
be observed that the sporocarps, and the contained spores
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">« 60 »</a></span>
or antheridia, are very delicate and destitute of the dense
outer wall of the macrospores. Hence such parts are
little likely to have been preserved in a fossil state; and
in the Erian shales, if present, they probably appear
merely as flocculent carbonaceous matter not distinctly
marked, or as minute granules not well defined, of which
there are great quantities in some of the shales.</p>

<p>The vegetation appertaining to the Sporangites has
not been distinctly recognised. I have, however, found
in one of the Brazilian specimens two sporocarps attached
to what seems a fragment of a cellular frond, and numerous
specimens of the supposed Algæ, named <i>Spirophyton</i>,
are found in the shales, but there is no evidence of any
connection of this plant with the <i>Protosalvinia</i>.</p>

<p>Modern Rhizocarps present considerable differences as
to their vegetative parts. Some, like <i>Pilularia</i>, have
simple linear leaves; others, like <i>Marsilea</i>, have leaves in
whorls, and cuneate in form; while others, like <i>Azolla</i>
and <i>Salvinia</i>, have frondose leaves, more or less pinnate
in their arrangement. If we inquire as to fossils representing
these forms of vegetation, we shall find that some
of the plants to be noticed in the immediate sequel may
have been nearly allied to the Rhizocarps. In the mean
time I may state that I have proposed the generic name
<i>Protosalvinia</i> for these curious macrospores and their
coverings, and have described in the paper in the &ldquo;Bulletin
of the Chicago Academy of Sciences,&rdquo; already
quoted, five species which may be referred to this genus.</p>

<p>These facts lead to inquiries as to the origin of the
bituminous matter which naturally escapes from the
rocks of the earth as petroleum and inflammable gas, or
which may be obtained from certain shales in these forms
by distillation. These products are compounds of carbon
and hydrogen, and may be procured from recent vegetable
substances by destructive distillation. Some vegetable
matters, also, are much richer in carbon and hydrogen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">« 61 »</a></span>
than others, and it is a remarkable fact that the spores of
certain cryptogamous plants are of this kind, as we see in
the inflammable character of the dry spores of Lycopodium;
and we know that the slow putrefaction of such
material underground effects chemical changes by which
bituminous matter can be produced. There is, therefore,
nothing unreasonable in the supposition advanced
by Prof. Orton, that the spores so abundantly contained
in the Ohio black shales are important or principal sources
of the bituminous matter which they contain. Microscopic
sections of this shale show that much of its material
consists of the rich bituminous matter of these spores
(<a href="#fig16">Fig. 16</a>). At the same time, while we may trace the
bitumen of these shales, and of some beds of coal, to this
cause, we must bear in mind that there are other kinds of
bituminous rocks which show no such structures, and may
have derived their combustible material from other kinds
of vegetable matter, whether of marine or of land plants.
We shall better understand this when we have considered
the origin of coal.</p>

<p>The macrospores above referred to may have belonged
to humble aquatic plants mantling the surfaces of water
or growing up from the bottom, and presenting little
aërial vegetation. But there are other Erian plants, as
already mentioned, which, while of higher structure, may
be of Rhizocarpean affinities.</p>

<p>One of these is the beautiful plant with whorls of
wedge-shaped leaves, to which the name <i>Sphenophyllum</i>
(see <a href="#fig20">Fig. 20</a>) has been given. Plants referred to this
genus have been described by Lesquereux from the upper
part of the Siluro-Cambrian,<a name="FNanchor_AP_42" id="FNanchor_AP_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_AP_42" class="fnanchor">[AP]</a> and a beautiful little species
occurs in the Erian shales of St. John, New Brunswick.<a name="FNanchor_AQ_43" id="FNanchor_AQ_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_AQ_43" class="fnanchor">[AQ]</a>
The genus is also continued, and is still more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">« 62 »</a></span>
abundant, in the Carboniferous. Many years ago I observed,
in a beautiful specimen collected by Sir W. E.
Logan, in New Brunswick, that the stem of this plant
had an axis of reticulated and scalariform vessels, and an
outer bark.<a name="FNanchor_AR_44" id="FNanchor_AR_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_AR_44" class="fnanchor">[AR]</a> Renault and Williamson have more recently
obtained more perfect specimens, and the former has
figured a remarkably complex triangular axis, containing
punctate and barred vessels, and larger punctate vessels
filling in its angles. Outside of this there is a cellular
inner bark, and this is surrounded by a thick fibrous envelope.
That a structure so complex should belong to
a plant so humble in its affinities is one of the strange
anomalies presented by the old world, and of which we
shall find many similar instances. The fruit of <i>Sphenophyllum</i>
was borne in spikes, with little whorls of bracts
or rudimentary leaves bearing round sporocarps.</p>

<p>A second type of plant, which may have been Rhizocarpean
in its affinities, is that to which I have given the
name <i>Ptilophyton</i>.<a name="FNanchor_AS_45" id="FNanchor_AS_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_AS_45" class="fnanchor">[AS]</a> It consists of beautiful feathery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">« 63 »</a></span>
fronds, apparently bearing on parts of the main stem or
petiole small rounded sporocarps. They are found abundantly
in the Middle Erian of the State of New York,
and also occur in Scotland, while one species appears to
occur in Nova Scotia, as high as the Lower Carboniferous
(Figs. <a href="#fig17">17</a>, <a href="#fig18">18</a>).</p>

<p>These organisms have been variously referred to Lycopods,

the belief that they were aquatic plants, more likely to
have been allied to Rhizocarps than to any other group.

<p>Another genus,
which I have named

may be regarded
as a connecting
link between the
Rhizocarps and the
Lycopods. It is so
named from its resemblance,
in some respects,
to the curious
parasitic Lycopods
placed in the modern
genus <i>Psilotum</i>. Several
species have been
described, and they are
eminently characteristic
of the Lower Erian,
in which they
were first discovered
in Gaspé. The typical
species, <i>Psilophyton
princeps</i>, which
fills many beds of shale
and sandstone in Gaspé
Bay and the head
of the neighbouring
Bay des Chaleurs with
its slender stems and
creeping, cord-like rhizomes,
may be thus described:</p>

<p>Stems branching

barren stems, numerous and spirally arranged; in fertile
stems and branchlets, sparsely scattered or absent; in
decorticated specimens, represented by a
minute punctate scars. Young branches
circinate; rhizomata cylindrical, covered
with hairs or ramenta, and having
circular areoles irregularly disposed, giving
origin to slender cylindrical rootlets.
Internal structure&mdash;an axis of scalariform
vessels, surrounded by a cylinder of
parenchymatous cells, and by an outer
cylinder of elongated woody cells. Fructification
consisting of naked oval spore-cases,
borne usually in pairs on slender,
curved pedicels, either lateral or terminal.</p>

</div>

<p>This species was fully described by me in the papers
referred to above, from specimens obtained from the rich
exposures at Gaspé Bay, and which enabled me to illustrate
its parts more fully, perhaps, than those of any
other species of so great antiquity. In the specimens I
had obtained I was able to recognise the forms of the
rhizomata, stems, branches, and rudimentary leaves, and
also the internal structure of the stems and rhizomata,
and to illustrate the remarkable resemblance of the forms
and structures to those of the modern <i>Psilotum</i>. The
fructification was, however, altogether peculiar, consisting
of narrowly ovate sporangia, borne usually in pairs,
on curved and apparently rigid petioles. Under the
microscope these sporangia show indications of cellular
structure, and appear to have been membranous in character.
In some specimens dehiscence appears to have
taken place by a slit in one side, and, clay having entered
into the interior, both walls of the spore-case can be seen.
In other instances, being flattened, they might be mistaken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">« 66 »</a></span>
for scales. No spores could be observed in any of
the specimens, though in some the surface was marked
by slight, rounded prominences, possibly the impressions
of the spores within. This peculiar and very simple style
of spore-case is also characteristic of other species, and
gives to <i>Psilophyton</i> a very distinct generic character.
These naked spore-cases may be compared to those of
such lycopodiaceous plants as <i>Psilotum</i>, in which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">« 67 »</a></span>
scales are rudimentary. They also bear some resemblance,
though on a much larger scale, to the spore-cases of some
Erian ferns (<i>Archæopteris</i>), to be mentioned in the
sequel. On the whole, however, they seem most nearly
related to the sporocarps of the Rhizocarpeæ.</p>

<p><i>Arthrostigma</i>, which is found in the same beds with
Psilophyton, was a plant of more robust growth, with
better-developed, narrow, and pointed leaves, borne in a
verticillate or spiral manner, and bearing at the ends of
its branches spikes of naked sporocarps, apparently similar
to those of <i>Psilophyton</i> but more rounded in form.
The two genera must have been nearly related, and the
slender branchlets of <i>Arthrostigma</i> are, unless well preserved,
scarcely distinguishable from the stems of <i>Psilophyton</i>.<a name="FNanchor_AU_47" id="FNanchor_AU_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_AU_47" class="fnanchor">[AU]</a></p>

<p>If, now, we compare the vegetation of these and similar
ancient plants with that of modern Rhizocarps, we
shall find that the latter still present, though in a depauperated
and diminished form, some of the characteristics
of their predecessors. Some, like <i>Pilularia</i>, have
simple linear leaves; others, like <i>Marsilea</i>, have leaves in
verticils and cuneate in form; while others, like Azolla
and Salvinia, have frondose leaves, more or less pinnate
in their arrangement. The first type presents little that
is characteristic, but there are in the Erian sandstones
and shales great quantities of filamentous and linear objects
which it has been impossible to refer to any genus,
and which might have belonged to plants of the type of
<i>Pilularia</i>. It is quite possible, also, that such plants as
<i>Psilophyton glabrum</i> and <i>Cordaites angustifolia</i>, of which
the fructification is quite unknown, may have been allied
to Rhizocarps. With regard to the verticillate type, we
are at once reminded of <i>Sphenophyllum</i> (<a href="#fig20">Fig. 20</a>), which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">« 68 »</a></span>
many palæobotanists have referred to the <i>Marsiliacæ</i>,
though, like other Palæozoic Acrogens, it presents complexities
not seen in its modern representatives. <i>S. primævum</i>
of Lesquereux is found in the Hudson River
group, and my <i>S. antiquum</i> in the Middle Erian. Besides
these, there are in the Silurian and Erian beds
plants with verticillate leaves which have been placed
with the Annulariæ, but which may have differed from
them in fructification. <i>Annularia laxa</i>, of the Erian,
and <i>Protannularia Harknessii</i>, of the Siluro-Cambrian,
may be given as examples, and must have been aquatic
plants, probably allied to Rhizocarps. It is deserving of
notice, also, that the two best-known species of <i>Psilophyton</i>
(<i>P. princeps</i> and <i>P. robustius</i>), while allied to Lycopods
by the structure of the stem and such rudimentary
foliage as they possess, are also allied, by the form of
their fructification, to the Rhizocarps, and not to ferns,
as some palæobotanists have incorrectly supposed. A
similar remark applies to <i>Arthrostigma</i>; and the beautiful
pinnately leaved <i>Ptilophyton</i> may be taken to represent
that type of foliage as seen in modern Rhizocarps, while
the allied forms of the Carboniferous which Lesquereux
has named <i>Trochophyllum</i>, seem to have had sporocarps
attached to the stem in the manner of <i>Azolla</i>.</p>

<p>The whole of this evidence, I think, goes to show that
in the Erian period there were vast quantities of aquatic
plants, allied to the modern Rhizocarps, and that the so-called
<i>Sporangites</i> referred to in this paper were probably
the drifted sporocarps and macrospores of some of these
plants, or of plants allied to them in structure and habit,
of which the vegetative organs have perished. I have
shown that in the Erian period there were vast swampy
flats covered with <i>Psilophyton</i>, and in similar submerged
tracts near to the sea the <i>Protosalvinia</i> may have filled
the waters and have given off the vast multitudes of
macrospores which, drifted by currents, have settled in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">« 69 »</a></span>
mud of the black shales. We have thus a remarkable
example of a group of plants reduced in modern times to
a few insignificant forms, but which played a great role in
the ancient Palæozoic world.</p>

<p>Leaving the Rhizocarps, we may now turn to certain
other families of Erian plants. The first to attract our
attention in this age would naturally be the Lycopods,
the club-mosses or ground-pines, which in Canada and
the Eastern States carpet the ground in many parts of
our woods, and are so available for the winter decoration
of our houses and public buildings. If we fancy one of
these humble but graceful plants enlarged to the dimensions
of a tree, we shall have an idea of a <i>Lepidodendron</i>,
or of any of its allies (Figs. <a href="#fig15">15</a>, <a href="#fig21">21</a>). These large lycopodiaceous
trees, which in different specific and generic
forms were probably dominant in the Erian woods, resembled
in general those of modern times in their fruit
and foliage, except that their cones were large, and probably
in most cases with two kinds of spores, and their
leaves were also often very long, thus bearing a due proportion
to the trees which they clothed. Their thick
stems required, however, more strength than is necessary
in their diminutive successors, and to meet this want
some remarkable structures were introduced similar to
those now found only in the stems of plants of higher
rank. The cells and vessels of all plants consist of thin
walls of woody matter, enclosing the sap and other contents
of these sacs and tubes, and when strength is required
it is obtained by lining their interior with successive
coats of the hardest form of woody matter, usually
known as lignin. But while the walls remain thin, they
afford free passage to the sap to nourish every part. If
thickened all over, they would become impervious to sap,
and therefore unsuited to one of their most important
functions. These two ends of strength and permeability
are secured by partial linings of lignin, leaving portions of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">« 70 »</a></span>
the original wall uncovered. But this may be done in a
great variety of ways.</p>

<p>The most ancient of these contrivances, and one still
continued in the world of plants, is that of the barred
or scalariform vessel. This may be either square or hexagonal,
so as to admit of being packed without leaving
vacancies. It is strengthened by a thick bar of ligneous
matter up each angle, and these are connected by cross-bars
so as to form a framework resembling several ladders
fastened together. Hence the name <i>scalariform</i>, or ladder-like.
Now, in a modern Lycopod there is a central
axis of such barred vessels associated with simpler fibres
or elongated cells. Even in <i>Sphenophyllum</i> and <i>Psilophyton</i>,
already referred to as allied to Rhizocarps,<a name="FNanchor_AV_48" id="FNanchor_AV_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_AV_48" class="fnanchor">[AV]</a> there
is such a central axis, and in the former rigidity is given
to this by the vascular and woody elements being arranged
in the form of a three-sided prism or three-rayed
star. But such arrangements would not suffice for a tree,
and hence in the arboreal Lycopods of the Erian age a
more complex structure is introduced. The barred vessels
were expanded in the first instance into a hollow
cylinder filled in with pith or cellular tissue, and the
outer rind was strengthened with greatly thickened cells.
But even this was not sufficient, and in the older stems
wedge-shaped bundles of barred tissue were run out from
the interior, forming an external woody cylinder, and inside
of the rind were placed bundles of tough bast fibres.
Thus, a stem was constructed having pith, wood, and
bark, and capable of additions to the exterior of the
woody wedges by a true exogenous growth. The plan is,
in short, the same with that of the stems of the exogenous
trees of modern times, except that the tissues employed
are less complicated. The structures of these remarkable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">« 71 »</a></span>
trees, and the manner in which they anticipate those of
the true exogens of modern times, have been admirably
illustrated by Dr. Williamson, of Manchester. His
papers, it is true, refer to these plants as existing in the
Carboniferous age, but there is every reason to believe
that they were of the same character in the Erian. The
plan is the same with that now seen in the stems of exogenous
phænogams, and which has long ceased to be used
in those of the Lycopods. In this way, however, large
and graceful lycopodiaceous trees were constructed in the
Erian period, and constituted the staple of its forests.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_AV_48" id="Footnote_AV_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AV_48"><span class="label">[AV]</span></a> First noticed by the author, &ldquo;Journal of Geological Society,&rdquo; 1865;
but more completely by Renault, &ldquo;Comptes Rendus,&rdquo; 1870.</p></div>

<p>The roots of these trees were equally remarkable with
their stems, and so dissimilar to any now existing that
botanists were long disposed to regard them as independent
plants rather than roots. They were similar in
general structure to the stems to which they belonged,
but are remarkable for branching in a very regular manner
by bifurcation like the stems above, and for the fact
that their long, cylindrical rootlets were arranged in a
spiral manner and distinctly articulated to the root after
the manner of leaves rather than of rootlets, and fitting
them for growing in homogeneous mud or vegetable
muck. They are the so-called <i>Stigmaria</i> roots, which,
though found in the Erian and belonging to its lycopodiaceous
plants, attained to far greater importance in the
Carboniferous period, where we shall meet with them again.</p>

<p>There were different types of lycopodiaceous plants
in the Erian. In addition to humble Lycopods like those
of our modern woods and great Lepidodendra, which were
exaggerated Lycopods, there were thick-stemmed and less
graceful species with broad rhombic scars (<i>Leptophleum</i>),
and others with the leaf-scars in vertical rows (<i>Sigillaria</i>),
and others, again, with rounded leaf-scars, looking like
the marks on Stigmaria, and belonging to the genus
<i>Cyclostigma</i>. Thus some variety was given to the arboreal
club-mosses of these early forests. (See <a href="#fig15">Fig. 15</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">« 72 »</a></span></p>

<p>Another group of plants which
attained to great development in
the Erian age is that of the Ferns
or Brackens. The oldest of these
yet known are found in the Middle
Erian. The <i>Eopteris</i> of Saporta,
from the Silurian, at one
time supposed to carry this type
much further back, has unfortunately
been found to be a mere
imitative form, consisting of
films of pyrites of leaf-like shapes,
and produced by crystallisation.
In the Middle Erian, however,
more especially in North America,
many species have been found
(Figs. <a href="#fig22">22</a> to <a href="#fig24">24</a>).<a name="FNanchor_AW_49" id="FNanchor_AW_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_AW_49" class="fnanchor">[AW]</a> I have myself
recorded more than thirty species
from the Middle Erian of
Canada, and these belong to several
of the genera found in the
Carboniferous, though some are
peculiar to the Erian. Of the
latter, the best known are perhaps
those of the genus <i>Archæopteris</i>
(<a href="#fig24">Fig. 24</a>), so abundant
in the plant-beds of Kiltorcan
in Ireland, as well as in North
America. In this genus the
fronds are large and luxuriant,
with broad obovate pinnules decurrent,
on the leaf-stalk, and
with simple sac-like spore-cases
borne on modified pinnæ. Another
very beautiful fern found
with <i>Archæopteris</i> is that which I have named <i>Platyphyllum</i>,
and which grew on a creeping stem or parasitically

<p>These aërial roots introduce us to a new contrivance

the soil multitudes of cord-like cylindrical roots from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">« 76 »</a></span>
various heights on the stem, and which form a series of
stays like the cordage of a ship. This method of support
still continues in the modern tree-ferns of the tropics
and the southern hemisphere. In one kind of tree-fern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">« 77 »</a></span>
stem from the Erian of New York, there is also a special
arrangement for support, consisting of a series of peculiarly
arranged radiating plates of scalariform vessels, not
exactly like those of an exogenous stem, but doing duty
for it (<i>Asteropteris</i>)<a name="FNanchor_BA_53" id="FNanchor_BA_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_BA_53" class="fnanchor">[BA]</a>
Similar plants have
been described from

by the former, but

<p>The history of the ferns in geological time is remarkably
different from that of the Lycopods; for while the
latter have long ago descended from their pristine eminence
to a very humble place in nature, the former still,
in the southern hemisphere at least, retain their arboreal
dimensions and ancient
dominance.</p>

<p>The family of
the <i>Equisetaceæ</i>, or
mare&rsquo;s-tails, was also
represented by large
species of <i>Calamites</i>
and by <i>Asterophyllites</i>
in the Erian;
but, as its headquarters
are in the Carboniferous,
we may
defer its consideration
till the next
chapter. (Figs. <a href="#fig27">27</a>,
<a href="#fig28">28</a>.)</p>

<p>Passing over these
for the present, we
find that the flowering
plants are represented
in the Erian
forests by at least
two types of Gymnosperms,
that of
<i>Taxineæ</i> or yews,
and an extinct family, that of the <i>Cordaites</i> (Figs. <a href="#fig30">30</a>, <a href="#fig31">31</a>).
The yew-trees are closely allied to the pines and spruces,
and are often included with them in the family of <i>Coniferæ</i>.
They differ, however, in the habit of producing berries or
drupe-like fruits instead of cones, and there is some
reason to believe that this was the habit of the Erian
trees of this group, though their wood in some instances
resembles rather that of the Araucaria, or Norfolk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">« 79 »</a></span>
Island pine, than that of the modern yews. These
trees are chiefly known to us by their mineralised trunks,
which are often found like drift-wood on modern sand-banks
embedded in the Erian sandstones or limestones.
It often shows its structure in the most perfect manner
in specimens penetrated by calcite or silica, or by
pyrite, and in which the original woody matter has
been resolved into anthracite or even into graphite.
These trees have true woody tissues presenting that beautiful
arrangement of pores or thin parts enclosed in cup-like
discs, which is characteristic of the coniferous trees,
and which is a great improvement on the barred tissue
already referred to, affording a far more strong, tough,
and durable wood, such as we have in our modern pines
and yews (<a href="#fig29">Fig. 29</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">« 80 »</a></span></p>

<p>These primitive pines make their appearance in the
Middle Erian, in various parts of America, as well as in
Scotland and Germany, and they are represented by wood
indicating the presence of several species. I have myself
indicated and described five species from the Erian of
Canada and the United States. From the fact that these
trees are represented by drifted trunks embedded in sandstones
and marine limestones, we may, perhaps, infer that
they grew on the rising grounds of the Erian land, and
that their trunks were carried by river-floods into the sea.
No instance has yet certainly occurred of the discovery of
their foliage or fruit, though there are some fan-shaped
leaves usually regarded as ferns which may have belonged
to such trees. These in that case would have resembled
the modern <i>Gingko</i> of China, and some of the fruits referred
to the genus <i>Cardiocarpum</i> may have been produced
by them. Various names have been given to these
trees. I have preferred that given by Unger, <i>Dadoxylon</i>,
as being more non-committal as to affinities than the
others.<a name="FNanchor_BC_55" id="FNanchor_BC_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_BC_55" class="fnanchor">[BC]</a> Many of these trees had very long internal
pith-cylinders, with curious transverse tubulæ, and which,
when preserved separately, have been named <i>Sternbergia</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_BC_55" id="Footnote_BC_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BC_55"><span class="label">[BC]</span></a> <i>Araucarites</i>, Goeppert; <i>Araucarioxylon</i>, Kraus.</p></div>

<p>Allied to these trees, and perhaps intermediate between
them and the <i>Cycads</i>, were those known as <i>Cordaites</i>
(<a href="#fig30">Fig. 30</a>), which had trunks resembling those of <i>Dadoxylon</i>,
but with still larger <i>Sternbergia</i> piths and an internal
axis of scalariform vessels, surrounded by a comparatively
thin woody cylinder. Some of them have leaves over a
foot in length, reminding one of the leaves of broad-leaved
grasses or iridaceous plants. Yet their flowers and fruit
seem to have been more nearly allied to the yews than to
any other plants (<a href="#fig31">Fig. 31</a>). Their stems were less woody
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">« 81 »</a></span>
and their piths larger than in the true pines, and some
of the larger-leaved species must have had thick, stiff
branches. They are regarded as constituting a separate
family, intermediate between pines and cycads, and, beginning
in the Middle Devonian, they terminate in the
Permian, where, however, some of the most gigantic species
occur. In so far as the form and structure of the
leaves, stems, and fruit are concerned, there is marvellously
little difference between the species found in the
Erian and the Permian. They culminated, however, in
the Carboniferous period, and the coal-fields of southern
France have proved so far the richest in their remains.</p>

<p>Lastly, a single specimen, collected by Prof. James

has been described by me as <i>Syringoxylon mirabile</i>.<a name="FNanchor_BD_56" id="FNanchor_BD_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_BD_56" class="fnanchor">[BD]</a>
This unique example is sufficient to establish the fact of
the existence of such plants at this early date, unless some
accident may have carried a specimen from a later formation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">« 83 »</a></span>
to be mixed with Erian fossils. It is to be observed,
however, that the non-occurrence of any similar wood in
all the formations between the Upper Erian and the Middle
Cretaceous suggests very grave doubt as to the authenticity
of the specimen. I record the fact, waiting further
discoveries to confirm it. Of the character of the specimen
which I have described I entertain no doubt.</p>

<p>We shall be better able to realise the significance and
relations of this ancient flora when we have studied that
of the succeeding Carboniferous. We may merely remark
here on the fact that, in these forests of the Devonian
and in the marshes on their margins, we find a wonderful
expansion of the now modest groups of Rhizocarps
and Lycopods, and that the flora as a whole belongs to
the highest group of Cryptogams and the lowest of Phænogams,
so that it has about it a remarkable aspect of
mediocrity. Further, while there is evidence of some
variety of station, there is also evidence of much equality
of climate, and of a condition of things more resembling
that of the insular climates of the temperate portions of
the southern hemisphere than that of North America or
Europe at present.</p>

<p>The only animal inhabitants of these Devonian woods,
so far as known, were a few species of insects, discovered
by Hartt in New Brunswick, and described by Dr. Scudder.
Since, however, we now know that scorpions as
well as insects existed in the Silurian, it is probable that
these also occurred in the Erian, though their remains
have not yet been discovered. All the known insects of
the Erian woods are allies of the shad-flies and grasshoppers
(<i>Neuroptera</i> and <i>Orthoptera</i>), or intermediate between
the two. It is probable that the larvæ of most of
them lived in water and fed upon the abundant vegetable
matter there, or on the numerous minute crustaceans and
worms. There were no land vertebrates, so far as known,
but there were fishes (<i>Dipterus</i>, etc.), allied to the modern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">« 84 »</a></span>
Barramunda or <i>Ceratodus</i> of Australia, and with
teeth suited for grinding vegetable food. It is also possible
that some of the smaller plate-covered fishes (Placoganoids,
like <i>Pterichthys</i>) might have fed on vegetable
matter, and, in any case, if they fed on lower animals, the
latter must have subsisted on plants. I mention these
facts to show that the superabundant vegetation of this
age, whether aquatic or terrestrial, was not wholly useless
to animals. It is quite likely, also, that we have yet
much to learn of the animal life of the Erian swamps and
woods.</p>

<p class="caption4">I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Classification of Sporangites</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is, of course, very unsatisfactory to give names to mere fragments
of plants, yet it seems very desirable to have some means of
arranging them. With respect to the organisms described above,
which were originally called by me <i>Sporangites</i>, under the supposition
that they were Sporangia rather than spores, this name
has so far been vindicated by the discovery of the spore-cases belonging
to them, so that I think it may still be retained as a provisional
name; but I would designate the whole as <i>Protosalviniæ</i>, meaning
thereby plants with rhizocarpean affinities, though possibly when
better understood belonging to different genera. We may under
these names speak of their detached discs as macrospores and of
their cellular envelopes as sporocarps. The following may be recognized
as distinct forms:</p>

<p>1. <i>Protosalvinia Huronensis</i>, Dawson, <i>Syn.</i>, <i>Sporangites Huronensis</i>,
&ldquo;Report on Erian Flora of Canada,&rdquo; 1871.&mdash;Macrospores, in
the form of discs or globes, smooth and thick-walled, the walls penetrated
by minute radiating pores. Diameter about one one-hundredth
of an inch, or a little more, When in situ several macrospores
are contained in a thin cellular sporocarp, probably globular
in form. From the Upper Erian, and perhaps Lower Carboniferous
shales of Kettle Point, Lake Huron, of various places in the State of
Ohio, and in the shale boulders of the boulder clay of Chicago and
vicinity. First collected at Kettle Point by Sir W. E. Logan, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">« 85 »</a></span>
in Ohio by Prof. Edward Orton, and at Chicago by Dr. H. A. Johnson
and Mr. B. W. Thomas, also in New York by Prof. J. M. Clarke.</p>

<p>The macrospores collected by Mr. Thomas from the Chicago
clays and shales conform closely to those of Kettle Point, and probably
belong to the same species. Some of them are thicker in the
outer wall, and show the pores much more distinctly. These have
been called by Mr. Thomas <i>S. Chicagoensis</i>, and may be regarded as
a varietal form. Specimens isolated from the shale and mounted
dry, show what seems to have been the hilum or scar of attachment
better than those in balsam.</p>

<p>Sections of the Kettle Point shale show, in addition to the macrospores,
wider and thinner shreds of vegetable matter, which I am
inclined to suppose to be remains of the sporocarps.</p>

<p>2. <i>Protosalvinia</i> (<i>Sporangites</i>) <i>Braziliensis</i>, Dawson, &ldquo;Canadian
Record of Science,&rdquo; 1883.&mdash;Macrospores, round, smooth, a little
longer than those of the last species, or about one seventy-fifth of
an inch in diameter, enclosed in round, oval, or slightly reniform
sporocarps, each containing from four to twenty-four macrospores.
Longest diameter of sporocarps three to six millimetres. Structure
of wall of sporocarps hexagonal cellular. Some sporocarps show no
macrospores, and may possibly contain microspores. The specimens
are from the Erian of Brazil. Discovered by Mr. Orville Derby.
The formation, according to Mr. Derby, consists of black shales below,
about three hundred feet thick, and containing the fucoid known
as Spirophyton, and probably decomposed vegetable matter. Above
this is chocolate and reddish shale, in which the well-preserved specimens
of Protosalvinia occur. These beds are very widely distributed,
and abound in <i>Protosalvinia</i> and <i>Spirophyton</i>.</p>

<p>3. <i>Protosalvinia</i> (<i>Sporangites</i>) <i>bilobata</i>, Dawson, &ldquo;Canadian
Record of Science,&rdquo; 1883.&mdash;Sporocarps, oval or reniform, three
to six millimetres in diameter, each showing two rounded
prominences at the ends, with a depression in the middle, and
sometimes a raised neck or isthmus at one side connecting the
prominences. Structure of sporocarp cellular. Some of the specimens
indicate that each prominence or tubercle contained several
macrospores. At first sight it would be easy to mistake these bodies
for valves of <i>Beyrichia</i>.</p>

<p>Found in the same formations with the last species, though, in so
far as the specimens indicate, not precisely in the same beds. Collected
by Mr. Derby.</p>

<p>4. <i>Protosalvinia Clarkei</i>, Dawson, <i>P. bilobata</i>, Clarke, &ldquo;American
Journal of Science.&rdquo;&mdash;Macrospores two-thirds to one millimetre in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">« 86 »</a></span>
diameter. One, two, or three contained in each sporocarp, which is
cellular. The macrospores have very thick walls with radiating tortuous
tubes. Unless this structure is a result of mineral crystallisation,
these macrospores must have had very thick walls and must have
resembled in structure the thickened cells of stone fruits and of the
core of the pear, or the tests of the Silurian and Erian seeds known
as <i>Pachytheca</i>, though on a smaller scale.</p>

<p>It is to be observed that bodies similar to these occur in the Boghead
earthy bitumen, and have been described by Credner.</p>

<p>I have found similar bodies in the so-called &ldquo;Stellar coal&rdquo; of the
coal district of Pictou, Nova Scotia, some layers of which are filled
with them. They occur in groups or patches, which seem to be enclosed
in a smooth and thin membrane or sporocarp. It is quite
likely that these bodies are generically distinct from <i>Protosalvinia</i>.</p>

<p>5. <i>Protosalvinia punctata</i>, Newton, &ldquo;Geological Magazine,&rdquo; New
Series, December 2d, vol. ii.&mdash;Mr. Newton has named the discs
found in the white coal and Tasmanite, <i>Tasmanites</i>, the species being
<i>Tasmanites punctatus</i>, but as my name <i>Sporangites</i> had priority,
I do not think it necessary to adopt this term, though there can be
little doubt that these organisms are of similar character. The same
remark may be made with reference to the bodies described by Huxley
and Newton as occurring in the Better-bed coal.</p>

<p>In Witham&rsquo;s &ldquo;Internal Structure of Fossil Vegetables,&rdquo; 1833,
Plate XI, are figures of Lancashire cannel which shows <i>Sporangites</i> of
the type of those in the Erian shales. Quekett, in his &ldquo;Report on the
Torbane Hill Mineral,&rdquo; 1854, has very well figured similar structures
from the Methel coal and the Lesmahagow cannel coal. These are
the earliest publications on the subject known to me; and Quekett,
though not understanding the nature of the bodies he observed,
holds that they are a usual ingredient in cannel coals.</p>


<p class="caption4">II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Nature and Affinities of Ptilophyton.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Lycopodites Vanuxemii</i> of &ldquo;Report on Devonian and Upper
Silurian Plants,&rdquo; Part I., page 35, <i>L. plumula</i> of &ldquo;Report on Lower
Carboniferous Plants,&rdquo; page 24, Plate I., Figs. 7, 8, 9.) In the reports
above referred to, these remarkable pinnate, frond-like objects
were referred to the genus <i>Lycopodites</i>, as had been done by Goeppert
in his description of the European species <i>Lycopodites pennæformis</i>,
which is very near to the American Erian form. Since 1871,
however, there have been many new specimens obtained, and very
various opinions expressed as to their affinities. While Hall has
named some of them <i>Plumalina</i>, and has regarded them as animal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">« 87 »</a></span>
structures, allied to hydroids, Lesquereux has described some of the
Carboniferous forms under the generic name <i>Trochophyllum</i>, which
is, however, more appropriate to plants with verticillate leaves which
are included in this genus. Before I had seen the publications of
Hall and Lesquereux on the subject, I had in a paper on &ldquo;Scottish
Devonian Plants&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_BE_57" id="FNanchor_BE_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_BE_57" class="fnanchor">[BE]</a> separated this group from the genus <i>Lycopodites</i>,
and formed for it the genus <i>Ptilophyton</i>, in allusion to the feather-like
aspect of the species. My reasons for this, and my present information
as to the nature of these plants, may be stated as follows:
Schimper, in his &ldquo;Palæontologie Vegetale&rdquo; (possibly from inattention
to the descriptions or want of access to specimens), doubts the
lycopodiaceous character of species of <i>Lycopodites</i> described in my
published papers on plants of the Devonian of America and in my
Report of 1871. Of these, <i>L. Richardsoni</i> and <i>L. Matthewi</i> are undoubtedly
very near to the modern genus <i>Lycopodium</i>. <i>L. Vanuxemii</i>
is, I admit, more problematical; but Schimper could scarcely
have supposed it to be a fern or a fucoid allied to <i>Caulerpa</i> had he
observed that both in my species and the allied <i>L. pennæformis</i> of
Goeppert, which he does not appear to notice, the pinnules are articulated
upon the stem, and leave scars where they have fallen off.
When in Belfast in 1870, my attention was again directed to the
affinities of these plants by finding in Prof. Thomson&rsquo;s collection a
specimen from Caithness, which shows a plant apparently of this
kind, with the same long narrow pinna? or leaflets, attached, however,
to thicker stems, and rolled up in a circinate manner. It seems
to be a plant in vernation, and the parts are too much crowded and
pressed together to admit of being accurately figured or described;
but I think I can scarcely be deceived as to its true nature. The
circinate arrangement in this case would favour a relationship to
ferns; but some lycopodiaceous plants also roll themselves in this
way, and so do the branches of the plants of the genus <i>Psilophyton</i>.
(<a href="#fig17">Fig. 17</a>, <i>supra</i>.)</p>

<p>The specimen consists of a short, erect stem, on which are placed
somewhat stout alternate branches, extending obliquely outward and
then curving inward in a circinate manner. The lower ones appear
to produce on their inner sides short lateral branchlets, and upon
these, and also upon the curved extremities of the branches, are long,
narrow, linear leaves placed in a crowded manner. The specimen is
thus not a spike of fructification, but a young stem or branch in vernation,
and which when unrolled would be of the form of those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">« 88 »</a></span>
peculiar pinnate <i>Lycopodites</i> of which <i>L. Vanuxemii</i> of the American
Devonian and <i>L. pennæformis</i> of the European Lower Carboniferous
are the types, and it shows, what might have been anticipated
from other specimens, that they were low, tufted plants, circinate in
vernation. The short stem of this plant is simply furrowed, and
bears no resemblance to a detached branch of Lycopodites Milleri
which lies at right angles to it on the same slab. As to the affinities
of the singular type of plants to which this specimen belongs, I may
quote from my &ldquo;Report on the Lower Carboniferous Plants of
Canada,&rdquo; in which I have described an allied species, <i>L. plumula</i>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The botanical relations of these plants must remain subject to
doubt, until either their internal structure or their fructification can
be discovered. In the mean time I follow Goeppert in placing them
in what we must regard as the provisional genus <i>Lycopodites</i>. On
the one hand, they are not unlike the slender twigs of <i>Taxodium</i>
and similar Conifers, and the highly carbonaceous character of the
stems gives some colour to the supposition that they may have been
woody plants. On the other hand, they might, so far as form is concerned,
be placed with Algæ of the type of Brongniart&rsquo;s <i>Chondrites
obtusus</i>, or the modern <i>Caulerpa plumaria</i>. Again, in a plant of
this type from the Devonian of Caithness to which I have referred in
a former memoir, the vernation seems to have been circinate, and
Schimper has conjectured that these plants may be ferns, which
seems also to have been the view of Shumard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the whole, these plants are allied to Lycopods rather than to
ferns; and as they constitute a small but distinct group, known only,
so far as I am aware, in the Lower Carboniferous and Erian or Devonian,
they deserve a generic name, and I proposed for them in my
&ldquo;Paper on Scottish Devonian Plants,&rdquo; 1878, that of <i>Ptilophyton</i>, a
name sufficiently distinct in sound from Psilophyton, and expressing
very well their peculiar feather-like habit of growth. The genus was
defined as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Branching plants, the branches bearing long, slender leaves in
two or more ranks, giving them a feathered appearance; vernation
circinate. Fruit unknown, but analogy would indicate that it was
borne on the bases of the leaves or on modified branches with shorter
leaves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Scottish specimen above referred to was named <i>Pt. Thomsoni</i>,
and was characterised by its densely tufted form and thick
branches. The other species known are: <i>Pt. pennæformis</i>, Goeppert,
L. Carboniferous; <i>Pt. Vanuxemii</i>, Dawson, Devonian; <i>Pt.
plumula</i>, Dawson, L. Carboniferous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">« 89 »</a></span></p>

<p>Shumard&rsquo;s <i>Filicites gracilis</i>, from the Devonian of Ohio, and
Stur&rsquo;s <i>Pinites antecedens</i>, from the Lower Carboniferous of Silesia,
may possibly belong to the same genus. The Scottish specimen referred
to is apparently the first appearance of this form in the
Devonian of Europe.</p>

<p>I have at a still later date had opportunities of studying considerable
series of these plants collected by Prof. Williams, of Cornell
University, and prepared a note in reference to them for the American
Association, of which, however, only an abstract has been published.
I have also been favoured by Prof. Lesquereux and Mr.
Lacoe, of Pittston, with the opportunity of studying the specimens
referred to <i>Trochophyllum</i>.</p>

<p>Prof. Williams&rsquo;s specimens occur in a dark shale associated with
remains of land-plants of the genera <i>Psilophyton</i>. <i>Rhodea</i>, &amp;c., and
also marine shells, of which a small species of <i>Rhynchonella</i> is often
attached to the stems of the <i>Ptilophyton</i>. Thus these organisms
have evidently been deposited in marine beds, but in association
with land-plants.</p>

<p>The study of the specimens collected by Prof. Williams develops
the following facts: (1) The plants are not continuous fronds, but
slender stems or petioles, with narrow, linear leaflets attached in a
pinnate manner. (2) The pinnules are so articulated that they break
off, leaving delicate transverse scars, and the lower parts of the stems
are often thus denuded of pinnæ for the length of one or more
inches. (3) The stems curve in such a manner as to indicate a circinate
vernation. (4) In a few instances the fronds were observed
to divide dichotomously toward the top; but this is rare. (5) There
are no indications of cells in the pinnules; but, on the other hand,
there is no appearance of fructification unless the minute granules
which roughen some of the sterns are of this nature. (6) The stems
seem to have been lax and flexuous, and in some instances they
seem to have grown on the petioles of ferns preserved with them in
the same beds. (7) The frequency of the attachment of small brachiopods
to the specimens of <i>Ptilophyton</i> would seem to indicate that
the plant stood erect in the water. (8) Some of the specimens show
so much carbonaceous matter as to indicate that the pinnules were
of considerable consistency. All these characters are those rather
of an aquatic plant than of an animal organism or of a land-plant.</p>

<p>The specimens communicated by Prof. Lesquereux and Mr.
Lacoe are from the Lower Carboniferous, and evidently represent a
different species with similar slender pitted stems, often partially
denuded of pinnules below; but the pinnules are much broader and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">« 90 »</a></span>
more distant. They are attached by very narrow bases, and apparently
tend to lie on a plane, though they may possibly have been
spirally arranged. On the same slabs are rounded sporangia or
macrospores like those of <i>Lepidodendron</i>, but there is no evidence
that these belonged to <i>Trochophyllum</i>. On the stems of this plant,
however, there are small, rounded bodies apparently taking the places
of some of the pinnules. These may possibly be spore-cases; but
they may be merely imperfectly developed pinnules. Still the fact
that similar small granules appear on the stems of the Devonian
species, favours the idea that they may be organs of fructification.</p>

<p>The most interesting discovery, however, which results from the
study of Mr. Lacoe&rsquo;s specimens, is that the pinnules were cylindrical
and hollow, and probably served to float the plant. This would
account for many of the peculiarities in the appearance and mode
of occurrence of the Devonian <i>Ptilophyton</i>, which are readily explained
if it is supposed to be an aquatic plant, attaching itself to
the stems of submerged vegetable remains and standing erect in the
water by virtue of its hollow leaves. It may well, however, have
been a plant of higher organisation than the Algæ, though no doubt
cryptogamous.</p>

<p>The species of <i>Ptilophyton</i> will thus constitute a peculiar group
of aquatic plants, belonging to the Devonian and Lower Carboniferous
periods, and perhaps allied to Lycopods and Pillworts in their
organisation and fruit, but specially distinguished by their linear
leaves serving as floats and arranged pinnately on slender stems.
The only species yet found within the limits of Canada is <i>Pt. plumula</i>,
found by Dr. Honeyman in the Lower Carboniferous of Nova
Scotia; but as <i>Pt. Vanuxemii</i> abounds in the Erian of New York,
it will no doubt be found in Canada also.</p>


<p class="caption4">III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tree-Ferns of the Erian Period.</span></p>

<p>As the fact of the occurrence of true tree-ferns in rocks so old
as the Middle Erian or Devonian has been doubted in some quarters,
the following summary is given from descriptions published in
the &ldquo;Journal of the Geological Society of London&rdquo; (1871 and 1881),
where figures of the species will be found:</p>

<p>Of the numerous ferns now known in the Middle and Upper
Devonian of North America, a great number are small and delicate
species, which were probably herbaceous; but there are other species
which may have been tree-ferns. Little definite information, however,
has, until recently, been obtained with regard to their habit of
growth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">« 91 »</a></span></p>

<p>The only species known to me in the Devonian of Europe is the
<i>Caulopteris Peachii</i> of Salter, figured in the &ldquo;Quarterly Journal of
the Geological Society&rdquo; for 1858. The original specimen of this I
had an opportunity of seeing in London, through the kindness of
Mr. Etheridge, and have no doubt that it is the stem of a small
arborescent fern, allied to the genus <i>Caulopteris</i>, of the coal formation.</p>

<p>In my paper on the Devonian of Eastern America (&ldquo;Quarterly
Journal of the Geological Society,&rdquo; 1862), I mentioned a plant found
by Mr. Richardson at Perry, as possibly a species of <i>Megaphyton</i>,
using that term to denote those stems of tree-ferns which have the
leaf-scars in two vertical series; but the specimen was obscure, and
I have not yet obtained any other.</p>

<p>More recently, in 1869, Prof. Hall placed in my hands an interesting
collection from Gilboa, New York, and Madison County, New
York, including two trunks surrounded by aërial roots, which I have
described as <i>Psaronius textilis</i> and <i>P. Erianus</i>, in my &ldquo;Revision of
the Devonian Flora,&rdquo; read before the Royal Society.<a name="FNanchor_BF_58" id="FNanchor_BF_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_BF_58" class="fnanchor">[BF]</a> In the same
collection were two very large petioles, <i>Rhachiopteris gigantea</i> and
<i>R. palmata</i>, which I have suggested may have belonged to tree-ferns.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_BF_58" id="Footnote_BF_58"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BF_58"><span class="label">[BF]</span></a> Abstract in &ldquo;Proceedings of the Royal Society,&rdquo; May, 1870; also
&ldquo;Report on Erian Plants of Canada,&rdquo; 1871.</p></div>

<p>My determination of the species of <i>Psaronius</i>, above mentioned,
has recently been completely confirmed by the discovery on the part
of Mr. Lockwood, of Gilboa, of the upper part of one of these stems,
with its leaf-scars preserved and petioles attached, and also by some
remarkable specimens obtained by Prof. Newberry, of New York,
from the Corniferous limestone of Ohio, which indicate the existence
there of three species of tree-ferns, one of them with aërial
roots similar to those of the Gilboa specimens. The whole of these
specimens Dr. Newberry has kindly allowed me to examine, and has
permitted me to describe the Gilboa specimen, as connected with
those which I formerly studied in Prof. Hall&rsquo;s collections. The
specimens from Ohio he has himself named, but allows me to notice
them here by way of comparison with the others. I shall add some
notes on specimens found with the Gilboa ferns.</p>

<p>It may be further observed that the Gilboa specimens are from
a bed containing erect stumps of tree-ferns, in the Chemung group
of the Upper Devonian, while those from Ohio are from a marine
limestone, belonging to the lower part of the Middle Devonian.</p>

<p>1. <i>Caulopteris Lockwoodi</i>, Dawson.&mdash;Trunk from two to three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">« 92 »</a></span>
inches in diameter, rugose longitudinally. Leaf-scars broad, rounded
above, and radiatingly rugose, with an irregular scar below, arranged
spirally in about five ranks; vascular bundles not distinctly preserved.
Petioles slender, much expanded at the base, dividing at
first in a pinnate manner, and afterwards dichotomously. Ultimate
pinnæ with remains of numerous, apparently narrow pinnules.</p>

<p>This stem is probably the upper part of one or other of the
species of <i>Psaronius</i> found in the same bed (<i>P. Erianus</i>, Dawson,
and <i>P. textilis</i>, Dawson).<a name="FNanchor_BG_59" id="FNanchor_BG_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_BG_59" class="fnanchor">[BG]</a> It appears to have been an erect stem
embedded in situ in sandstone, and preserved as a cast. The stem
is small, being only two inches, or a little more, in diameter. It
is coarsely wrinkled longitudinally, and covered with large leaf-scars,
each an inch in diameter, of a horseshoe-shape. The petioles,
five of which remain, separate from these scars with a distinct
articulation, except at one point near the base, where probably a
bundle or bundles of vessels passed into the petiole. They retain
their form at the attachment to the stem, but a little distance
from it they are flattened. They are inflated at the base, and somewhat
rapidly diminish in size. The leaf-scars vary in form, and are
not very distinct, but they appear to present a semicircular row of
pits above, largest in the middle. From these there proceed downward
a series of irregular furrows, converging to a second and more
obscure semicircle of pits, within or below which is the irregular scar
or break above referred to. The attitude and form of the petioles
will be seen from <a href="#fig24">Fig. 24</a>, <i>supra</i>.</p>

May, 1870.</p></div>

<p>The petioles are broken off within a few inches of the stem;
but other fragments found in the same beds appear to show their
continuation, and some remains of their foliage. One specimen
shows a series of processes at the sides, which seem to be the remains
of small pinnæ, or possibly of spines on the margin of the
petiole. Other fragments show the division of the frond, at first in
a pinnate manner, and subsequently by bifurcation; and some fragments
show remains of pinnules, possibly of fertile pinnules. These
are very indistinct, but would seem to show that the plant approached,
in the form of its fronds and the arrangement of its
fructification, to the Cyclopterids of the sub-genus <i>Aneimites</i>, one of
which (<i>Aneimites Acadica</i>), from the Lower Carboniferous of Nova
Scotia, I have elsewhere described as probably a tree-fern,<a name="FNanchor_BH_60" id="FNanchor_BH_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_BH_60" class="fnanchor">[BH]</a> The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">« 93 »</a></span>
fronds were evidently different from those of <i>Archæopteris</i><a name="FNanchor_BI_61" id="FNanchor_BI_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_BI_61" class="fnanchor">[BI]</a> a genus
characteristic of the same beds, but of very different habit of growth.
This accords with the fact that there is in Prof. Hall&rsquo;s collection a
mass of fronds of <i>Cyclopteris</i> (<i>Archæopteris</i>) Jacksoni, so arranged
as to make it probable that the plant was an herbaceous fern, producing
tufts of fronds on short stems in the ordinary way. The
obscurity of the leaf-scars may render it doubtful whether the plant
above described should be placed in the genus <i>Caulopteris</i> or in <i>Stemmatopteris</i>;
but it appears most nearly allied to the former. The
genus is at present, of course, a provisional one; but I have thought
it only justice to the diligent labours of Mr. Lockwood to name
this curious and interesting fossil <i>Caulopteris Lockwoodi</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_BH_60" id="Footnote_BH_60"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BH_60"><span class="label">[BH]</span></a> &ldquo;Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society,&rdquo; 1860.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_BI_61" id="Footnote_BI_61"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BI_61"><span class="label">[BI]</span></a> The genus to which the well-known <i>Cyclopteris</i> (<i>Adiantites</i>) <i>Hibernicus</i>
of the Devonian of Ireland belongs.</p></div>

<p>I have elsewhere remarked on the fact that trunks, and petioles,
and pinnules of ferns are curiously dissociated in the Devonian beds&mdash;an
effect of water-sorting, characteristic of a period in which the
conditions of deposition were so varied. Another example of this
is, that in the sandstones of Gaspé Bay, which have not as yet afforded
any example of fronds of ferns, there are compressed trunks,
which Mr. Lockwood&rsquo;s specimens allow me at least to conjecture
may have belonged to tree-ferns, although none of them are sufficiently
perfect for description.</p>

<p>Mr. Lockwood&rsquo;s collection includes specimens of <i>Psaronius textilis</i>;
and in addition to these there are remains of erect stems somewhat
different in character, yet possibly belonging to the higher parts
of the same species of tree-fern. One of these is a stem crushed in
such a manner that it does not exhibit its form with any distinctness,
but surrounded by smooth, cylindrical roots, radiating from it in
bundles, proceeding at first horizontally, and then curving downward,
and sometimes terminating in rounded ends. They resemble
in form and size the aërial roots of <i>Psaronius Erianus</i>; and I believe
them to be similar roots from a higher part of the stem, and some
of them young and not prolonged sufficiently far to reach the ground.
This specimen would thus represent the stem of <i>P. Erianus</i> at a
higher level than those previously found. We can thus in imagination
restore the trunk and crown of this once graceful tree-fern,
though we have not the detail of its fronds. Mr. Lockwood&rsquo;s
collections also contain a specimen of the large fern-petiole which
I have named <i>Rhachiopteris punctata</i>. My original specimen
was obtained by Prof. Hall from the same horizon in New York.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">« 94 »</a></span>
That of Mr. Lockwood is of larger size, but retains no remains of the
frond. It must have belonged to a species quite distinct from <i>Caulopteris
Lockwoodi</i>, but which may, like it, have been a tree-fern.</p>

<p>2. <i>Caulopteris antiqua</i>, Newberry.&mdash;This is a flattened stem, on
a slab of limestone, containing Brachiopods, Trilobites, &amp;c., of the
Corniferous limestone. It is about eighteen inches in length, and
three and a half inches in average breadth. The exposed side shows
about twenty-two large leaf-scars arranged spirally. Each leaf,
where broken off, has left a rough fracture; and above this is a
semicircular impression of the petiole against the stem, which, as
well as the surface of the bases of the petioles, is longitudinally
striated or tuberculated. The structures are not preserved, but
merely the outer epidermis, as a coaly film. The stem altogether
much resembles <i>Caulopteris Peachii</i>, but is of larger size. It differs
from <i>C. Lockwoodi</i> in the more elongated leaf-bases, and in the
leaves being more remotely placed; but it is evidently of the same
general character with that species.</p>

<p>3. <i>Caulopteris</i> (<i>Protopteris</i>) <i>peregrina</i>, Newberry.&mdash;This is a
much more interesting species than the last, as belonging to a generic
or subgeneric form not hitherto recognised below the Carboniferous,
and having its minute structure in part preserved.</p>

<p>The specimens are, like the last, on slabs of marine limestone of
the Corniferous formation, and flattened. One represents an upper
portion of the stem with leaf-scars and remains of petioles; another
a lower portion, with aërial roots. The upper part is three inches
in diameter, and about a foot in length, and shows thirty leaf-scars
which are about three-fourths of an inch wide, and rather less in
depth. The upper part presents a distinct rounded and sometimes
double marginal line, sometimes with a slight depression in the middle.
The lower part is irregular, and when most perfect shows seven
slender vascular bundles, passing obliquely downward into the stem.
The more perfect leaf-bases have the structure preserved, and show
a delicate, thin-walled, oval parenchyma, while the vascular bundles
show scalariform vessels with short bars in several rows, in the manner
of many modern ferns. Some of the scars show traces of the
hippocrepian mark characteristic of <i>Protopteris</i>; and the arrangement
of the vascular bundles at the base of the scars is the same as
in that genus, as are also the general form and arrangement of the
scars. On careful examination, the species is indeed very near to the
typical <i>P. Sternbergii</i>, as figured by Corda and Schimper.<a name="FNanchor_BJ_62" id="FNanchor_BJ_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_BJ_62" class="fnanchor">[BJ]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">« 95 »</a></span></p></div>

<p>The genus <i>Protopteris</i> of Sternberg, though the original species
(<i>P. punctata</i>) appears as a <i>Lepidodendron</i> in his earlier plate (Plate
4), and as a <i>Sigillaria</i> (<i>S. punctata</i>) in Brongniart&rsquo;s great work, is a
true tree-fern; and the structure of one species (<i>P. Cottai</i>) has been
beautifully figured by Corda. The species hitherto described are
from the Carboniferous and Permian.</p>

<p>The second specimen of this species represents a lower part of
the stem. It is thirteen inches long and about four inches in diameter,
and is covered with a mass of flattened aërial roots lying parallel
to each other, in the manner of the <i>Psaronites</i> of the coal-formation
and of <i>P. Erianus</i> of the Upper Erian or Devonian.</p>

<p>4. <i>Asteropteris noveboracensis</i>, gen. and sp. n.&mdash;The genus <i>Asteropteris</i>
is established for stems of ferns having the axial portion
composed of vertical radiating plates of scalariform tissue embedded
in parenchyma, and having the outer cylinder composed of elongated
cells traversed by leaf-bundles of the type of those of <i>Zygopteris</i>.</p>

<p>The only species known to me is represented by a stem 2&middot;5 centimetres
in diameter, slightly wrinkled and pitted externally, perhaps
by traces of aërial roots which have perished. The transverse
section shows in the centre four vertical plates of scalariform or imperfectly
reticulated tissue, placed at right angles to each other, and
united in the middle of the stem. At a short distance from the
centre, each of these plates divides into two or three, so as to form
an axis of from ten to twelve radiating plates, with remains of cellular
tissue filling the angular interspaces. The greatest diameter of
this axis is about 1&middot;5 centimetre. Exterior to the axis the stem consists
of elongated cells, with somewhat thick walls, and more dense
toward the circumference. The walls of these cells present a curious
reticulated appearance, apparently caused by the cracking of the
ligneous lining in consequence of contraction in the process of carbonization.
Embedded in this outer cylinder are about twelve vascular
bundles, each with a dumb-bell-shaped group of scalariform
vessels enclosed in a sheath of thick-walled fibres. Each bundle is
opposite to one of the rays of the central axis. The specimen shows
about two inches of the length of the stem, and is somewhat bent,
apparently by pressure, at one end.</p>

<p>This stem is evidently that of a small tree-fern of a type, so
far as known to me, not before described,<a name="FNanchor_BK_63" id="FNanchor_BK_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_BK_63" class="fnanchor">[BK]</a> and constituting a very
complex and symmetrical form of the group of Palæozoic ferns allied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">« 96 »</a></span>
to the genus <i>Zygopteris</i> of Schimper. The central axis alone has a
curious resemblance to the peculiar stem described by Unger (&ldquo;Devonian
Flora of Thuringia&rdquo;) under the name of <i>Cladoxylon mirabile</i>;
and it is just possible that this latter stem may be the axis
of some allied plant. The large aërial roots of some modern tree-ferns
of the genus <i>Angiopteris</i> have, however, an analogous radiating
structure.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_BK_63" id="Footnote_BK_63"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BK_63"><span class="label">[BK]</span></a> Prof. Williamson, to whom I have sent a tracing of the structure,
agrees with me that it is new.</p></div>

<p>The specimen is from the collection of Berlin H. Wright, Esq.,
of Penn Yan, New York, and was found in the Portage group (Upper
Erian) of Milo, New York, where it was associated with large petioles
of ferns and trunks of <i>Lepidodendra</i>, probably <i>L. Chemungense</i> and
<i>L. primævum</i>.</p>

<p>The occurrence of this and other stems of tree-ferns in marine
beds has recently been illustrated by the observation of Prof. A.
Agassiz that considerable quantities of vegetable matter can be
dredged from great depths in the sea on the leeward side of the
Caribbean Islands. The occurrence of these trunks further connects
itself with the great abundance of large petioles (<i>Rhachiopteris</i>) in
the same beds, while the rarity of well-preserved fronds is explained
by the coarseness of the beds, and also by the probably long maceration
of the plant-remains in the sea-water.</p>

<p>In connection with this I may refer to the remarkable facts recently
stated by Williamson<a name="FNanchor_BL_64" id="FNanchor_BL_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_BL_64" class="fnanchor">[BL]</a> respecting the stems known as Heterangium
and <i>Lyginodendron</i>. It would seem that these, while having
strong exogenous peculiarities, are really stems of tree-ferns, thus
placing this family in the same position of advancement with the
Lycopods and Equisetaceæ of the Coal period.</p>

<p class="caption4">IV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">On Erian Trees of the Genus Dadoxylon, Unger.</span><br />
(<i>Araucarites</i> <span class="smcap">of Goeppert</span>, <i>Araucarioxylon</i> <span class="smcap">of Kraus.</span>)</p>

<p>Large woody trunks, carbonised or silicified, and showing wood-cells
with hexagonal areoles having oval pores inscribed in them,
occur abundantly in some beds of the Middle Erian of America, and
constitute the most common kind of fossil wood all the way to the
Trias. They have in the older formations, generally, several rows
of pores on each fibre, and medullary rays composed of two or more
series of cells, but become more simple in these respects in the Permian
and Triassic series. The names <i>Araucarites</i> and <i>Araucarioxylon</i>
are perhaps objectionable, inasmuch as they suppose affinities to
<i>Araucaria</i> which may not exist. Unger&rsquo;s name, which is non-committal,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">« 97 »</a></span>
is therefore, I think, to be preferred. In my &ldquo;Acadian
Geology,&rdquo; and in my &ldquo;Report on the Geology of Prince Edward
Island,&rdquo; I have given reasons for believing that the foliage of some
at least of these trees was that known as <i>Walchia</i>, and that they may
have borne nutlets in the manner of Taxine trees (<i>Trigonocarpum</i>,
&amp;c). Grand d&rsquo;Eury has recently suggested that some of them may
have belonged to <i>Cordaites</i>, or to plants included in that somewhat
varied and probably artificial group.</p>

<p>The earliest discovery of trees of this kind in the Erian of
America was that of Matthew and Hartt, who found large trunks,
which I afterwards described as <i>Dadoxylon Ouangondianum</i>, in the
Erian sandstone of St. John, New Brunswick, hence named by those
geologists the &ldquo;Dadoxylon sandstone.&rdquo; A little later, similar wood
was found by Prof. Hall and Prof. Newberry in the Hamilton group
of New York and Ohio, and the allied wood of the genus <i>Ormoxylon</i>
was obtained by Prof. Hall in the Portage group of the former
State. These woods proved to be specifically distinct from that of
St. John, and were named by me <i>D. Halli</i>, <i>D. Newberryi</i>, and <i>Ormoxylon
Erianum</i>. The three species of <i>Dadoxylon</i> agreed in having
composite medullary rays, and would thus belong to the group
<i>Palæoxylon</i> of Brongniart. In the case of <i>Ormoxylon</i> this character
could not be very distinctly ascertained, but the medullary rays
appeared to be simple.</p>

<p>I am indebted to Prof. J. M. Clarke, of Amherst College, Massachusetts,
for some well-preserved specimens of another species from
the Genesee shale of Canandaigua, New York. They show small
steins or branches, with a cellular pith surrounded with wood of
coniferous type, showing two to three rows of slit-formed, bordered
pores in hexagonal borders. The medullary sheath consists of
pseudo-scalariform and reticulated fibres; but the most remarkable
feature of this wood is the structure of the medullary rays, which
are very frequent, but short and simple, sometimes having as few
as four cells superimposed. This is a character not before observed
in coniferous trees of so great age, and allies this Middle Erian
form with some Carboniferous woods which have been supposed to
belong to <i>Cordaites</i> or <i>Sigillaria</i>. In any case this structure is new,
and I have named the species <i>Dadoxylon Clarkii</i>, after its discoverer.
The specimens occur, according to Prof. Clarke, in a calcareous layer
which is filled with the minute shells of <i>Styliola fissurella</i> of Hall,
believed to be a Pteropod; and containing also shells of <i>Goniatites</i>
and <i>Gyroceras</i>. The stems found are only a few inches in diameter,
but may be branches of larger trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">« 98 »</a></span></p>

<p>It thus appears that we already know five species of Coniferous
trees of the genus <i>Dadoxylon</i> in the Middle Erian of America, an
interesting confirmation of the facts otherwise known as to the
great richness and variety of this ancient flora. The late Prof.
Goeppert informed me that he had recognised similar wood in the
Devonian of Germany, and there can be no doubt that the fossil
wood discovered by Hugh Miller in the Old Red Sandstone of Scotland,
and described by Salter and McNab, is of similar character, and
probably belongs to the genus <i>Dadoxylon</i>. Thus this type of Coniferous
tree seems to have been as well established and differentiated
into species in the Middle Devonian as in the succeeding Carboniferous.</p>

<p>I may here refer to the fact that the lower limit of the trees of
this group coincides, in America, with the upper limit of those problematical
trees which in the previous chapter I have named Protogens
(<i>Nematophyton</i>, <i>Celluloxlyon</i>,<a name="FNanchor_BM_65" id="FNanchor_BM_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_BM_65" class="fnanchor">[BM]</a> <i>Nematoxylon</i><a name="FNanchor_BN_66" id="FNanchor_BN_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_BN_66" class="fnanchor">[BN]</a>), though <i>Aporoxylon</i>
of Unger extends, in Thuringia, up to the Upper Devonian
(Cypridina schists).</p>

(Edinburgh Geological Society, 1877.)</p>

<p>Previously to the appearance of my descriptions of Devonian
plants from North America, Hugh Miller had described forms from
the Devonian of Scotland, similar to those for which I proposed the
generic name <i>Psilophyton</i>; and I referred to these in this connection
in my earliest description of that genus.<a name="FNanchor_BO_67" id="FNanchor_BO_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_BO_67" class="fnanchor">[BO]</a> He had also recognised
what seemed to be plants allied to Lycopods and Conifers. Mr.
Peach and Mr. Duncan had made additional discoveries of this kind,
and Sir J. Hooker and Mr. Salter had described some of these remains.
More recently Messrs. Peach, Carruthers, and McNab have
worked in this field, and still later<a name="FNanchor_BP_68" id="FNanchor_BP_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_BP_68" class="fnanchor">[BP]</a> Messrs. Jack and Etheridge
have summed up the facts and have added some that are new.</p>

<p>The first point to which I shall refer, and which will lead to the
other matters to be discussed, is the relation of the characteristic
<i>Lepidodendron</i> of the Devonian of eastern America, <i>L. Gaspianum</i>,
to <i>L. nothum</i> of Unger and of Salter. At the time when I described
this species I had not access to Scottish specimens of <i>Lepidodendron</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">« 99 »</a></span>
from the Devonian, but these had been well figured and described
by Salter, and had been identified with <i>L. nothum</i> of Unger, a species
evidently distinct from mine, as was also that figured and described
by Salter, whether identical or not with Unger&rsquo;s species. In 1870
I had for the first time an opportunity to study Scottish specimens
in the collection of Mr. Peach; and on the evidence thus afforded I
stated confidently that these specimens represented a species distinct
from <i>L. Gaspianum</i>, perhaps even generically so.<a name="FNanchor_BQ_69" id="FNanchor_BQ_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_BQ_69" class="fnanchor">[BQ]</a> It differs from
<i>L. Gaspianum</i> in its habit of growth by developing small lateral
branches instead of bifurcating, and in its foliage by the absence or
obsolete character of the leaf-bases and the closely placed and somewhat
appressed leaves. If an appearance of swelling at the end of a
lateral branch in one specimen indicates a strobile of fructification,
then its fruit was not dissimilar from that of the Canadian species
in its position and general form, though it may have differed in
details. On these grounds I declined to identify the Scottish species
with <i>L. Gaspianum</i>. The Lepidodendron from the Devonian of
Belgium described and figured by Crepin,<a name="FNanchor_BR_70" id="FNanchor_BR_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_BR_70" class="fnanchor">[BR]</a> has a better claim to such
identification, and would seem to prove that this species existed in
Europe as well as in America. I also saw in Mr. Peach&rsquo;s collection
in 1870 some fragments which seemed to me distinct from Salter&rsquo;s
species, and possibly belonging to <i>L. Gaspianum</i>.<a name="FNanchor_BS_71" id="FNanchor_BS_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_BS_71" class="fnanchor">[BS]</a></p>

<p>In the earliest description of <i>Psilophyton</i> I recognised its probable
generic affinity with Miller&rsquo;s &ldquo;dichotomous plants,&rdquo; with Salter&rsquo;s
&ldquo;rootlets,&rdquo; and with Goeppert&rsquo;s <i>Haliserites Dechenianus</i>, and stated
that I had &ldquo;little doubt that materials exist in the Old Red Sandstone
of Scotland for the reconstruction of at least one species of
this genus.&rdquo; Since, however, Miller&rsquo;s plants had been referred to
coniferous roots, and to fucoids, and Goeppert&rsquo;s <i>Haliserites</i> was a
name applicable only to fucoids, and since the structure and fruit
of my plants placed them near to Lycopods, I was under the necessity
of giving them a special generic name, nor could I with certainty
affirm their specific identity with any European species. The
comparison of the Scottish specimens with woody rootlets, though
incorrect, is in one respect creditable to the acumen of Salter, as in
almost any state of preservation an experienced eye can readily perceive
that branchlets of <i>Psilophyton</i> must have been woody rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">« 100 »</a></span>
than herbaceous, and their appearance is quite different from that
of any true Algæ.</p>

<p>The type of <i>Psilophyton</i> is my <i>P. princeps</i>, of which the whole
of the parts and structures are well known, the entire plant being
furnished in abundance and in situ in the rich plant-beds of Gaspé.
A second species, <i>P. robustius</i>, has also afforded well-characterised
fructification. <i>P. elegans</i>, whose fruit appears as &ldquo;oval scales,&rdquo; no
doubt bore sac-like spore-cases resembling those of the other species,
but in a different position, and perfectly flattened in the specimens
procured. The only other Canadian species, <i>P. glabrum</i>, being somewhat
different in appearance from the others, and not having afforded
any fructification, must be regarded as uncertain.</p>

<p>The generic characters of the first three species may be stated as
follows:</p>

<p>Stems dichotomous, with rudimentary subulate leaves, sometimes
obsolete in terminal branchlets and fertile branches; and in decorticated
specimens represented only by punctiform scars. Young
branches circinate. Rhizomata cylindrical, with circular root-areoles.
Internal structure of stem, an axis of scalariform vessels
enclosed in a sheath of imperfect woody tissue and covered with a
cellular bark more dense externally. Fruit, naked sac-like spore-cases,
in pairs or clusters, terminal or lateral.</p>

<p>The Scottish specimens conform to these characters in so far as
they are known, but not having as yet afforded fruit or internal
structure, they cannot be specifically determined with certainty.
More complete specimens should be carefully searched for, and will
no doubt be found.</p>

<p>In Belgium, M. Crepin has described a new species from the
Upper Devonian of Condroz under the name <i>P. Condrusianum</i>
(1875). It wants, however, some of the more important characters of
the genus, and differs in having a pinnate ramification, giving it the
aspect of a fern. In a later paper (1876) the author considers this
species distinct from <i>Psilophyton</i>, and proposes for it a new generic
name <i>Rhacophyton</i>.</p>

<p>The characters given by Mr. Carruthers, in his paper of 1873, for
the species <i>P. Dechenianum</i>, are very few and general: &ldquo;Lower
branches short and frequently branching, giving the plant an oblong
circumscription.&rdquo; Yet even these characters do not apply, so far as
known, to Miller&rsquo;s fucoids or Salter&rsquo;s rootlets or Goeppert&rsquo;s <i>Haliserites</i>.
They merely express the peculiar mode of branching already
referred to in Salter&rsquo;s <i>Lepidodendron nothum</i>. The identification of
the former plants with the <i>Lepidodendron</i> and <i>Lycopodites</i>, indeed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">« 101 »</a></span>
rests only on mere juxtaposition of fragments, and on the slight resemblance
of the decorticated ends of the branches of the latter plants
to <i>Psilophyton</i>. It is contradicted by the obtuse ends of the
branches of the <i>Lepidodendron</i> and <i>Lycopodites</i>, and by the apparently
strobilaceous termination of some of them.</p>

<p>Salter&rsquo;s description of his <i>Lepidodendron nothum</i> is quite definite,
and accords with specimens placed in my hands by Mr. Peach:
&ldquo;Stems half an inch broad, tapering little, branches short; set on at
an acute angle, blunt at their terminations. Leaves in seven to ten
rows, very short, not a line long, and rather spreading than closely
imbricate.&rdquo; These characters, however, in so far as they go, are
rather those of the genus <i>Lycopodites</i> than of <i>Lepidodendron</i>, from
which this plant differs in wanting any distinct leaf-bases, and in its
short, crowded leaves. It is to be observed that they apply also to
Salter&rsquo;s <i>Lycopodites Milleri</i>, and that the difference of the foliage
of that species may be a result merely of different state of preservation.
For these reasons I am disposed to place these two supposed
species together, and to retain for the species the name
<i>Lycopodites Milleri</i>. It may be characterised by the description
above given, with merely the modification that the leaves are sometimes
nearly one-third of an inch long and secund (<a href="#fig17">Fig. 17</a>, <i>supra</i>,
lower figure).</p>

<p>Decorticated branches of the above species may no doubt be mistaken
for <i>Psilophyton</i>, but are nevertheless quite distinct from it, and
the slender branching dichotomous stems, with terminations which,
as Miller graphically states, are &ldquo;like the tendrils of a pea,&rdquo; are too
characteristic to be easily mistaken, even when neither fruit nor
leaves appear. With reference to fructification, the form of <i>L.
Milleri</i> renders it certain that it must have borne strobiles at the
ends of its branchlets, or some substitute for these, and not naked
spore-cases like those of <i>Psilophyton</i>.</p>

<p>The remarkable fragment communicated by Sir Philip Egerton
to Mr. Carruthers,<a name="FNanchor_BT_72" id="FNanchor_BT_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_BT_72" class="fnanchor">[BT]</a> belongs to a third group, and has, I think, been
quite misunderstood. I am enabled to make this statement with
some confidence, from the fact that the reverse or counterpart of Sir
Philip&rsquo;s specimen was in the collection of Sir Wyville Thomson, and
was placed by him in my hands in 1870. It was noticed in my
paper on &ldquo;New Devonian Plants,&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Journal of the Geological
Society of London,&rdquo; and referred to my genus <i>Ptilophyton</i>, as
stated above under Section II., <a href="#Page_86">page 86</a> <i>et seq.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Salter described, in 1857,<a name="FNanchor_BU_73" id="FNanchor_BU_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_BU_73" class="fnanchor">[BU]</a> fragments of fossil wood from the
Scottish Devonian, having the structure of Dadoxylon, though very
imperfectly preserved; and Prof. McNab has proposed<a name="FNanchor_BV_74" id="FNanchor_BV_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_BV_74" class="fnanchor">[BV]</a> the generic
name <i>Palæopitys</i> for another specimen of coniferous wood collected
by Hugh Miller, and referred to by him in the &ldquo;Testimony of the
Rocks.&rdquo; From Prof. McNab&rsquo;s description, I should infer that this
wood may, after all, be generically identical with the woods usually
referred to Dadoxylon of Unger (<i>Araucarioxylon</i> of Kraus). The
description, however, does not mention the number and disposition
of the rows of pores, nor the structure of the medullary rays, and I
have not been able to obtain access to the specimens themselves. I
have described five species of Dadoxylon from the Middle and Upper
Erian of America, all quite distinct from the Lower Carboniferous
species. There is also one species of an allied genus, Ormoxylon.
All these have been carefully figured, and it is much to be desired
that the Scottish specimens should be re-examined and compared
with them.</p>

<p>Messrs. Jack and Etheridge have given an excellent summary
of our present knowledge of the Devonian flora of Scotland, in the
Journal of the London Geological Society (1877). From this it
would appear that species referable to the genera <i>Calamities</i>, <i>Lepidodendron</i>,
<i>Lycopodites</i>, <i>Psilophyton</i>, <i>Arthrostigma</i>, <i>Archæopteris</i>,
<i>Caulopteris</i>, <i>Palæopitys</i>, <i>Araucarioxylon</i>, and <i>Stigmaria</i> have been
recognised.</p>

<p>The plants described by these gentlemen from the Old Red
Sandstone of Callender, I should suppose, from their figures and
descriptions, to belong to the genus <i>Arthrostigma</i>, rather than to
Psilophyton. I do not attach any importance to the suggestions referred
to by them, that the apparent leaves may be leaf-bases. Long
leaf-bases, like those characteristic of <i>Lepidofloyos</i>, do not occur in
these humbler plants of the Devonian. The stems with delicate
&ldquo;horizontal processes&rdquo; to which they refer may belong to <i>Ptilophyton</i>
or to <i>Pinnularia</i>.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I need scarcely say that I do not share in the
doubts expressed by some British palæontologists as to the distinctness
of the Devonian and Carboniferous floras. In eastern America,
where these formations are mutually unconformable, there is, of
course, less room for doubt than in Ireland and in western America,
where they are stratigraphically continuous. Still, in passing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">« 103 »</a></span>
from the one to the other, the species are for the most part different,
and new generic forms are met with, and, as I have elsewhere
shown, the physical conditions of the two periods were essentially
different.<a name="FNanchor_BW_75" id="FNanchor_BW_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_BW_75" class="fnanchor">[BW]</a></p>

Canada.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>It is, however, to be observed that since&mdash;as Stur and others have
shown&mdash;<i>Calamities radiatus</i>, and other forms distinctively Devonian
in America, occur in Europe in the Lower Carboniferous, it is not
unlikely that the Devonian flora, like that of the Tertiary, appeared
earlier in America. It is also probable, as I have shown in the &ldquo;Reports&rdquo;
already referred to, that it appeared earlier in the Arctic than
in the temperate zone. Hence an Arctic or American flora, really
Devonian, may readily be mistaken for Lower Carboniferous by a
botanist basing his calculations on the fossils of temperate Europe.
Even in America itself, it would appear, from recent discoveries in
Virginia and Ohio, that certain Devonian forms lingered longer in
those regions than farther to the northeast;<a name="FNanchor_BX_76" id="FNanchor_BX_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_BX_76" class="fnanchor">[BX]</a> and it would not be
surprising if similar plants occurred in later beds in Devonshire or
in the south of Europe than in Scotland. Still, these facts, properly
understood, do not invalidate the evidence of fossil plants as to
geological age, though errors arising from the neglect of them are
still current.</p>

<p class="caption4">VI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Geological Relations of some Plant-bearing Beds of

<p>The Gaspé sandstones have been fully described by Sir W. E.
Logan, in his &ldquo;Report on the Geology of Canada,&rdquo; 1863. He there
assigns to them a thickness of seven thousand and thirty-six feet,
and shows that they rest conformably on the Upper Silurian limestones
of the Lower Helderberg group (Ludlow), and are in their
turn overlaid unconformably by the conglomerates which form the
base of the Carboniferous rocks of New Brunswick. I shall add
here merely a few remarks on points in their physical character
connected with the occurrence of plants in them.</p>

<p><i>Prototaxites</i> (<i>Nematophyton</i>) <i>Logani</i> and other characteristic
Lower Erian plants occur in the base of the sandstones at Little
Gaspé. This fact, along with the occurrence, as stated in my paper
of 1863, of rhizomes of <i>Psilophyton</i> preserving their scalariform
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">« 104 »</a></span>
structure, in the upper part of the marine Upper Silurian limestones,<a name="FNanchor_BY_77" id="FNanchor_BY_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_BY_77" class="fnanchor">[BY]</a>
proves the flora of the Devonian rocks to have had its
beginning at least in the previous geological period, and to characterise
the lower as well as the upper beds of the Devonian series. In
this connection I may state that, from their marine fossils, as well
as their stratigraphical arrangement, Sir W. E. Logan and Mr.
Billings regard the lower portions of the Gaspé sandstones as the
equivalents of the Oriskany sandstone of New York. On the other
hand, the great thickness of this formation, the absence of Lower
Devonian fossils from its upper part, and the resemblance of the
upper beds to those of the newer members of the Devonian elsewhere,
render it probable that the Gaspé sandstones, though deficient
in the calcareous members of the system, seen farther to the
westward, represent the whole of the Devonian period.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_BY_77" id="Footnote_BY_77"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BY_77"><span class="label">[BY]</span></a> The marine fossils of these beds have been determined by Mr.
Billings. They are Upper Silurian, with an intermixture of Lower Devonian
in the upper part. Fragments of <i>Nematophyton</i> occur in beds of
the same age in the Bay des Chaleurs, at Cape Bon Ami.</p></div>

<p>The Gaspé sandstones, as their name imports, are predominantly
arenaceous, and often coarsely so, the sandstones being frequently
composed of large grains and studded with quartz-pebbles. Grey
and buff are prevalent colours, but red beds also occur, more especially
in the upper portion. There are also interstratified shaly
beds, sometimes occurring in groups of considerable thickness, and
associated with fine-grained and laminated argillaceous sandstone,
the whole having in many places the lithological aspect of the coal-measures.
At one place, near the middle of the series, there is a
bed of coal from one inch to three inches in thickness, associated
with highly bituminous shales abounding in remains of plants, and
also containing fragments of crustaceans and fishes (<i>Pterygotus</i>,
<i>Ctenacanthus ?</i> &amp;c). The beds connected with this coal are grey
sandstones and grey and dark shales, much resembling those of the
ordinary coal formation. The coal is shining and laminated, and
both its roof and floor consist of laminated bituminous shale with
fragments of <i>Psilophyton</i>. It has no true under-clay, and has been,
I believe, a peaty mass of rhizomes of <i>Psilophyton</i>. It occurs near
Tar Point, on the south side of Gaspé Bay, a place so named from
the occurrence of a thick dyke of trap holding petroleum in its
cavities. The coal is of considerable horizontal extent, as in its line
of strike a similar bed has been discovered on the Douglas River,
about four miles distant. It has not been recognised on the north
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">« 105 »</a></span>
side of the bay, though we find there beds, probably on very nearly
the same horizon, holding <i>Psilophyton</i> in situ.</p>

<p>As an illustration of one of the groups of shaly beds, and of the
occurrence of roots of <i>Psilophyton</i>, I may give the following sectional
list of beds seen near &ldquo;Watering Brook,&rdquo; on the north shore
of the bay. The order is descending:</p>

<p>Groups of beds similar to the above, but frequently much more
rich in fossils, occur in many parts of the section, and evidently include
fossil soils of the nature of under-clays, on which little else
appears to have grown than a dense herbage of <i>Psilophyton</i>, along
with plants of the genus <i>Arthrostigma</i>.</p>

<p>In addition to these shaly groups, there are numerous examples
of beds of shale of small thickness included in coarse sandstones,
and these beds often occur in detached fragments, as if the remnants
of more continuous layers partially removed by currents of
water. It is deserving of notice that nearly all these patches of
shale are interlaced with roots or stems of <i>Psilophyton</i>, which sometimes
project beyond their limits into the sandstone, as if the vegetable
fibres had preserved the clay from removal. In short, these
lines of patches of shale seem to be remnants of soils on which
<i>Psilophyton</i> has flourished abundantly, and which have been partially
swept away by the currents which deposited the sand. Some
of the smaller patches may even be fragments of tough swamp soils
interwoven with roots, drifted by the agency of the waves or possibly
by ice; such masses are often moved in this way on the borders of
modern swamps on the sea-coast.</p>

<p>The only remaining point connected with local geology to which
I shall allude is the admirable facilities afforded by the Gaspé coast
both for ascertaining the true geological relations of the beds, and
for studying the Devonian plants, as distinctly exposed on large surfaces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">« 106 »</a></span>
of rock. On the coast of the river St. Lawrence, at Cape
Rozier and its vicinity, the Lower Silurian rocks of the Quebec
group are well exposed, and are overlaid unconformably by the massive
Upper Silurian limestones of Cape Gaspé, which rise into cliffs
six hundred feet in height, and can be seen filled with their characteristic
fossils on both sides of the cape. Resting upon these, and
dipping at high angles toward Gaspé Bay, are the Devonian sandstones,
which are exposed in rugged cliffs slightly oblique to their
line of strike, along a coast-line of ten miles in length, to the head
of the bay. On the opposite side of the bay they reappear; and,
thrown into slight undulations by three anticlinal curves, occupy
a line of coast fifteen miles in length. The perfect manner in which
the plant-bearing beds are exposed in these fine natural sections may
serve to account for the completeness with which the forms and
habits of growth of the more abundant species can be described.</p>

<p>In the Bay des Chaleurs, similar rocks exist with some local
variations. In the vicinity of Campbellton are calcareous and magnesian
breccia or agglomerate, hard shales, conglomerates and sandstones
of Lower Devonian age. The agglomerate and lower shales
contain abundant remains of fishes of the genera <i>Cephalaspis</i>, <i>Coccosteus</i>,
<i>Ctenacanthus</i>, and <i>Homacanthus</i>, and also fragments of
<i>Pterygotus</i>. The shales and sandstones abound in remains of <i>Psilophyton</i>,
with which are <i>Nematophyton</i>, <i>Arthrostigma</i>, and <i>Leptophleum</i>
of the same species found in the Lower Devonian of Gaspé
Bay. These beds near Campbellton dip to the northward, and the
Restigouche River here occupies a synclinal, for on the opposite side,
at Bordeaux Quarry, there are thick beds of grey sandstone dipping
to the southward, and containing large silicified trunks of Prototaxites,
in addition to <i>Psilophyton</i>. These beds are all undoubtedly
Lower Erian, but farther to the eastward, on the north side of the
river, there are newer and overlying strata. These are best seen at
Scaumenac Bay, opposite Dalhousie, between Cape Florissant and
Maguacha Point, where they consist of laminated and fine-grained
sandstone, with shales of grey colours, but holding some reddish beds
at top, and overlaid unconformably by a great thickness of Lower
Carboniferous red conglomerate and sandstone. In these beds numerous
fossil fishes have been found, among which Mr. Whiteaves
recognises species of <i>Pterichthys</i>, <i>Glyptolepis</i>, <i>Cheirolepis</i>, &amp;c. With
these are found somewhat plentifully four species of fossil ferns, all
of Upper Erian types, of which one is peculiar to this locality; but
the others are found in the Upper Erian of Perry, in Maine, or in
the Cat skill group of New York.</p>

<p>In order that distinct notions may be conveyed as to the geological
horizons of the species, I may state that the typical Devonian
or Erian series of Canada and New York may be divided in descending
order into&mdash;1. The Chemung group, including the Chemung and
Portage sandstones and shales. 2. The Hamilton group, including
the Genesee, Hamilton, and Marcellus shales. 3. The Corniferous
limestone and its associated beds. 4 The Oriskany sandstone. As
the Corniferous limestone, which is the equivalent of the Lower
Carboniferous limestone in the Carboniferous period, is marine, and
affords scarcely any plants, we may, as is usually done for like purposes
in the Carboniferous, group it with the Oriskany under the
name Lower Erian. The Hamilton rocks will then be Middle Erian,
and the Chemung group Upper Erian. In the present state of our
knowledge, the series may be co-ordinated with the rocks of Gaspé,
New Brunswick, and Maine, as in the following table:</p>

<p>It may be proper, before closing this note, to state the reasons
which have induced me to suggest in the following pages the use of
the term &ldquo;Erian,&rdquo; as equivalent to &ldquo;Devonian,&rdquo; for the great system
of formations intervening between the Upper Silurian and the
Lower Carboniferous in America. I have been induced to adopt
this course by the following considerations: 1. The great area of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">« 108 »</a></span>
undisturbed and unaltered rocks of this age, including a thickness
in some places of eighteen thousand feet, and extending from east
to west through the Northern States of the Union and western
Canada for nearly seven hundred miles, while it spreads from north
to south from the northern part of Michigan far into the Middle
States, is undoubtedly the most important Devonian area now known
to geologists. 2. This area has been taken by all American geologists
as their typical Devonian region. It is rich in fossils, and
these have been thoroughly studied and admirably illustrated by
the New York and Canadian Surveys. 3. The rocks of this area
surround the basin of Lake Erie, and were named, in the original
reports of the New York Survey, the &ldquo;<i>Erie Division</i>&rdquo; 4. Great
difficulties have been experienced in the classification of the European
Devonian, and the uncertainties thus arising have tended to
throw doubt on the results obtained in America in circumstances in
which such difficulties do not occur.</p>

<p>These reasons are, I think, sufficient to warrant me in holding
the great <i>Erie Division</i> of the New York geologists as the typical
representative of the rocks deposited between the close of the Upper
Silurian and the beginning of the Carboniferous period, and to use
the term Erian as the designation of this great series of deposits as
developed in America, in so far at least as their flora is concerned.
In doing so, I do not wish to introduce a new name merely for the
sake of novelty; but I hope to keep before the minds of geologists
the caution that they should not measure the Erian formations of
America, or the fossils which they contain, by the comparatively
depauperated representatives of this portion of the geological scale
in the Devonian of western Europe.</p>


<p class="caption4">VII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">On the Relations of the so-called &ldquo;Ursa Stage&rdquo; of Bear Island<br />
with the Palæozoic Flora of North America.</span></p>

<p>The following note is a verbatim copy of that published by me
in 1873, and the accuracy of which has now been vindicated by the
recent observations of Nathorst:</p>

<p>The plants catalogued by Dr. Heer, and characterising what he
calls the &ldquo;Ursa Stage,&rdquo; are in part representatives of those of the
American flora which I have described as the &ldquo;Lower Carboniferous
Coal-Measures&rdquo; (Subcarboniferous of Dana), and whose characteristic
species, as developed in Nova Scotia, I noticed in the &ldquo;Journal of
the Geological Society&rdquo; in 1858 (vol. xv.). Dr. Heer&rsquo;s list, however,
includes some Upper Devonian forms; and I would suggest that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">« 109 »</a></span>
either the plants of two distinct beds, one Lower Carboniferous and
the other Upper Devonian, have been near to or in contact with each
other and have been intermixed, or else that in this high northern
latitude, in which (for reasons stated in my &ldquo;Report on the Devonian
Flora&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_BZ_78" id="FNanchor_BZ_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_BZ_78" class="fnanchor">[BZ]</a>) I believe the Devonian plants to have originated, there
was an actual intermixture of the two floras. In America, at the
base of the Carboniferous of Ohio, a transition of this kind seems
to occur; but elsewhere in northeastern America the Lower Carboniferous
plants are usually unmixed with the Devonian.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_BZ_78" id="Footnote_BZ_78"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BZ_78"><span class="label">[BZ]</span></a> &ldquo;Geological Survey of Canada,&rdquo; 1871.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Heer, however, proceeds to identify these plants with those
of the American Chemung, and even with those of the Middle Devonian
of New Brunswick, as described by me&mdash;a conclusion from
which I must altogether dissent, inasmuch as the latter belong to
beds which were disturbed and partially metamorphosed before the
deposition of the lowest Carboniferous or &ldquo;Subcarboniferous&rdquo; beds.</p>

<p>Dr. Heer&rsquo;s error seems to have arisen from want of acquaintance
with the rich flora of the Middle Devonian, which, while differing in
species, has much resemblance in its general facies, and especially in
its richness in ferns, to that of the coal-formation.</p>

<p>To geologists acquainted with the stratigraphy and the accompanying
animal fossils, Dr. Heer&rsquo;s conclusions will of course appear
untenable; but they may regard them as invalidating the evidence
of fossil plants; and for this reason it is, I think, desirable to give
publicity to the above statements.</p>

<p>I consider the British equivalent of the lower coal-measures of
eastern America to be the lower limestone shales, the <i>Tweedian
group</i> of Mr. Tate (1858), but which have sometimes been called the
&ldquo;Calciferous Sandstone&rdquo; (a name preoccupied for a Cambrian group
in America). This group does not constitute &ldquo;beds of passage&rdquo; to
the Devonian, more especially in eastern America, where the lower
coal-formation rests unconformably on the Devonian, and is broadly
distinguished by its fossils.</p>

<p>The above notes would not have been extended to so great
length, but for the importance of the Erian flora as the precursor
of that of the Carboniferous, and the small amount of attention
hitherto given to it by geologists and botanists.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ascending</span> from the Erian to the Carboniferous system,
so called because it contains the greatest deposits of
anthracite and bituminous coal, we are still within the
limits of the Palæozoic period. We are still within the
reign of the gigantic club-mosses, cordaites, and taxine
pines. At the close of the Erian there had been over
the whole northern hemisphere great changes of level,
accompanied by active volcanic phenomena, and under
these influences the land flora seems to have much diminished.
At length all the old Erian species had become
extinct, and their place was supplied by a meagre group
of lycopods, ferns, and pines of different species from
those of the preceding Erian. This is the flora of the
Lower Carboniferous series, the Tweedian of England,
the Horton series of Nova Scotia, the lower coal-measures
of Virginia, the culm of Germany. But the land
again subsided, and the period of the marine limestone
of the Lower Carboniferous was introduced. In this the
older flora disappeared, and when the land emerged we
find it covered with the rich flora of the coal-formation
proper, in which the great tribes of the lycopods and
cordaites attained their maxima, and the ferns were continued
as before, though under new generic and specific
forms.</p>

<p>There is something very striking in this succession of
a new plant world without any material advance. It is
like passing in the modern world from one district to
another, in which we see the same forms of life, only
represented by distinct though allied species. Thus, when
the voyager crosses the Atlantic from Europe to America,
he meets with pines,
oaks, birches, poplars,
and beeches of the same
genera with those he
had left behind; but
the species are distinct.
It is something like this
that meets us in our ascent
into the Carboniferous
world of plants.
Yet we know that this
is a succession in time,
that all our old Erian
friends are dead and
buried long ago, and
that these are new forms
lately introduced (<a href="#fig32">Fig. 32</a>).</p>

<p>Conveying ourselves,
then, in imagination forward
to the time when
our greatest accumulations
of coal were formed,
and fancying that we are introduced to the American
or European continent of that period, we find ourselves
in a new and strange world. In the Devonian
age, and even in the succeeding Lower Carboniferous,
there was in the interior of America a wide inland sea,
with forest belts clinging to its sides or clothing its islands.
But in the coal period this inland sea had given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">« 112 »</a></span>
place to vast swampy flats, and which, instead of the oil-bearing
shales of the Erian, were destined to produce
those immense and wide-spread accumulations of vegetable
matter which constitute our present beds of bituminous
and anthracite coal. The
atmosphere of these great swamps
is moist and warm. Their vegetation
is most exuberant, but of
forms unfamiliar to modern eyes,
and they swarm with insects,
millipedes, and scorpions, and
with batrachian reptiles large
and small, among which we look
in vain for representatives of the
birds and beasts of the present
day.</p>

<p>Prominent among the more
gigantic trees of these swampy
forests are those known to us as
<i>Sigillariæ</i> (<a href="#fig33">Fig. 33</a>). They have
tall, pillar-like trunks, often several
feet in diameter, ribbed like
fluted columns, but in the reverse
way, and spreading at the
top into a few thick branches,
which are clothed with long,
grass-like leaves. They resemble
in some respects the Lepidodendra
of the Erian age, but
are more massive, with ribbed instead
of scaly trunks, and longer
leaves. If we approach one of
them more closely, we are struck with the regular ribs of
its trunk, dotted with rows of scars of fallen leaves, from
which it receives its name <i>Sigillaria</i>, or seal-tree (Figs. <a href="#fig34">34</a>-<a href="#fig37">37</a>).
If we cut into its stem, we find that, instead of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">« 113 »</a></span>
the thin bark and firm wood with which we are familiar
in our modern trees, it has a hard external rind, then a
great thickness of cellular matter with rope-like bands of
fibres, constituting an inner bark, while in the centre is
a firm, woody axis of comparatively small diameter, and
somewhat intermediate in its structures between that of
the Lepidodendra and those of the cycads and the taxine
conifers. Thus a great stem, five feet in diameter, may
consist principally of cellular and bast fibres with very
little true woody matter. The roots of this tree are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">« 114 »</a></span>
perhaps its most singular feature. They usually start
from the stem in four main branches, then regularly
bifurcate several times, and then run out into great
cylindrical cables, running for a long distance, and evidently
intended to anchor the plant firmly in a soft and
oozy soil. They were furnished
with long, cylindrical rootlets
placed regularly in a spiral manner,
and so articulated that when
they dropped off they left regular
rounded scars. They are,
in short, the <i>Stigmariæ</i>, which
we have already met with in
the Erian (Figs. <a href="#fig38">38</a>, <a href="#fig39">39</a>). In
<a href="#fig33">Fig. 33</a> I have endeavoured to
restore these strange trees. It is
not wonderful that such plants
have caused much botanical controversy.
It was long before botanists
could be convinced that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">« 115 »</a></span>
their roots are properly roots at all, and not stems
of some aquatic plant. Then the structure of their
stems is most puzzling, and their fruit is an enigma,
for while some have found connected with them cones
supposed to resemble those of
lycopods, others attribute to
them fruits like those of yew-trees.
For years I have been
myself gathering materials from
the rich coal-formation deposits
of Nova Scotia in aid of the
solution of these questions, and
in the mean time Dr. Williamson,
of Manchester, and Renault
and other botanists in France,
have been amassing and studying
stores of specimens, and it
is still uncertain who may finally
be the fortunate discoverer
to set all controversies at rest. My present belief is,
that the true solution consists in the fact that there are
many kinds of <i>Sigillariæ</i>. While in the modern forests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">« 116 »</a></span>
of America and Europe the species of any of our ordinary
trees, as oaks, birches, or maples, may almost be counted
on one&rsquo;s fingers, Schimper in his vegetable palæontology
enumerates about eighty species of Carboniferous <i>Sigillariæ</i>;
and while on the one hand many of these are so
imperfectly known that they may be regarded as uncertain,
on the other hand many species must yet remain to
be discovered.<a name="FNanchor_CA_79" id="FNanchor_CA_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_CA_79" class="fnanchor">[CA]</a> Now, in so vast a number of species
there must be a great range of organisation, and, indeed,
it has already been attempted to subdivide them into
several generic groups. The present state of the question
appears to me to be this, that in these <i>Sigillariæ</i> we have
a group divisible into several forms, some of which will
eventually be classed with the Lepidodendra as lycopods,
while others will be found to be naked-seeded phænogams,
allied to the pines and cycads, and to a remarkable
group of trees known as <i>Cordaites</i>, which we must shortly
notice.</p>

<p style="clear: both;">Before considering other forms of Carboniferous vegetation,
let us glance at the accumulation of coal, and the
agency of the forests of <i>Sigillariæ</i> therein. Let us imagine,
in the first instance, such trees as those represented
in the figures, growing thickly together over vast swampy
flats, with quantities of undergrowth of ferns and other
plants beneath their shade, and accumulating from age to
age in a moist soil and climate a vast thickness of vegetable
mould and trunks of trees, and spores and spore-cases,
and we have the conditions necessary for the growth
of coal. Many years ago it was observed by Sir William
Logan that in the coal-field of South Wales it was the
rule with rare exceptions that, under every bed of coal,
there is a bed of clay filled with roots of the <i>Stigmaria</i>,
already referred to as the root of <i>Sigillaria</i>. This discovery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">« 117 »</a></span>
has since been extended to all the coal-fields of
Europe and America, and it is a perfectly conclusive fact
as regards the origin of coal. Each of these &ldquo;under-clays,&rdquo;
as they are called, must, in fact, have been a soil
on which grew, in the first instance, Sigillariæ and other
trees having stigmaria-roots. Thus, the growth of a
forest of <i>Sigillariæ</i> was the first step toward the accumulation
of a bed of coal. More than this, in some of the
coarser and more impure coals, where there has been
sufficient earthy matter to separate and preserve impressions
of vegetable forms, we can see that the mass of the
coal is made up of flattened <i>Sigillariæ</i>, mixed with vegetable
<i>débris</i> of all kinds, including sometimes vast quantities
of lepidodendroid spores, and the microscopic study
of the coal gives similar results (<a href="#fig40">Fig. 40</a>). Further, on
the surfaces of many coals, and penetrating the shales or
sandstones which form their roofs, we find erect stumps
of sigillaria and other trees, showing that the accumulation
of the coal terminated as it had begun, by a forest-growth.
I introduce here a section of a few of the numerous
beds of coal exposed in the cliffs of the South
Joggins, in Nova Scotia, in illustration of these facts.
We can thus see how in the slowly subsiding areas of the
coal-swamps successive beds of coal were accumulated,
alternating with beds of sandstone and shale (Figs. <a href="#fig41">41</a>,
<a href="#fig42">42</a>). For other details of this kind I must refer to
papers mentioned in the sequel.</p>

<p>Returning to the more special subject of this work, I
may remark that the lepidodendroid trees and the ferns,
both the arborescent and herbaceous kinds, are even more
richly represented in the Carboniferous than in the preceding
Erian, I must, however, content myself with

the more common
kinds, in an appended

<p>Another group
which claims our
attention is that
of the <i>Calamites</i>.
These are tall, cylindrical,
branchless
stems, with
whorls of branchlets,
bearing needle-like
leaves and spreading in stools from the base, so as to
form dense thickets, like Southern cane-brakes (<a href="#fig46">Fig. 46</a>).
They bear, in habit of growth and fructification, a close
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">« 119 »</a></span>
relation to our modern equisetums, or mare&rsquo;s-tails, but,
as in other cases we have met with, are of gigantic size
and comparatively complex structure. Their stems, in
cross-section, show radiating
bundles of fibres,
like those of exogenous
woods, yet the whole plan
of structure presents some
curious resemblances to
the stems of their humble
successors, the modern
mare&rsquo;s-tails. It would
seem, from the manner
in which dense brakes of
these <i>Calamites</i> have been
preserved in the coal-formation
of Nova Scotia,
that they spread over low
and occasionally inundated
flats, and formed
fringes on the seaward
sides of the great Sigillaria
forests. In this way
they no doubt contributed
to prevent the invasion of the areas of coal accumulation
by the muddy waters of inundations, and
thus, though they may not have furnished much of the
material of coal, they no doubt contributed to its purity.
Many beautiful plants of the genera Asterophyllites and
<i>Annularia</i> are supposed to have been allied to the <i>Calamites</i>,
or to have connected them with the <i>Rhizocarps</i>.
The stems and fruit of these plants have strong points of
resemblance to those of <i>Sphenophyllum</i>, and the leaves
are broad, and not narrow and angular like those of the
true <i>Calamites</i> (<a href="#fig45">Fig. 45</a>).</p>

<p>No one has done more than my friend Dr. Williamson,
of Manchester, to illustrate the structure of Calamites,
and he has shown that these plants, like other
cryptogams of the Carboniferous, had mostly stems with
regular fibrous wedges, like those of exogens. The
structure of the stem is, indeed, so complex, and differs
so much in different stages of growth, and different states
of preservation, that we are in danger of falling into the
greatest confusion in classifying these plants. Sometimes
what we call a Calamite is a mere cast of its pith showing
longitudinal striæ and constrictions at the nodes. Sometimes
we have the form of the outer surface of the woody
cylinder, showing longitudinal ribs, nodes, and marks of
the emission of the branchlets. Sometimes we have the
outer surface of the plant covered with a smooth bark
showing flat ribs, or almost smooth, and having at the
nodes regular articulations with the bases of the verticillate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">« 123 »</a></span>
branchlets, or on the lower part of the stem the
marks of the attachment of the roots. The Calamites
grew in dense clumps, budding off from one another,
sometimes at different levels, as the mud or sand accumulated
about their stems, and in some
species there were creeping rhizomata
or root-stocks (Figs. <a href="#fig46">46</a> to <a href="#fig49">49</a>).</p>

<p>But all Calamites were not alike
in structure. In a recent paper<a name="FNanchor_CC_81" id="FNanchor_CC_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_CC_81" class="fnanchor">[CC]</a>
Dr. Williamson describes three distinct structural types.
What he regards as typical Calamites has in its woody
zone wedges of barred vessels, with thick bands of cellular
tissue separating them. A second type, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">« 124 »</a></span>
he refers to <i>Calamopitus</i>, has woody bundles composed
of reticulated or multiporous fibres, with their
porous sides parallel to the medullary rays, which are
better developed than in the previous form. The intervening
cellular masses are composed of elongated cells.
This is a decided advance in structure, and is of the type
of those forms having the most woody and largest stems,
which Brongniart named <i>Calamodendron</i> (<a href="#fig50">Fig. 50</a>). A
third form, to which Dr. Williamson seems to prefer to
assign this last name, has the tissue of the woody wedges
barred, as in the first, but the medullary rays are better
developed than in the second. In this third form the
intermediate tissue, or primary medullary rays, is truly
fibrous, and with secondary medullary rays traversing it.
My own observations lead me to infer that there was a
fourth type of calamitean stem, less endowed with woody
matter, and having a larger fistulous or cellular cavity
than any of those described by Dr. Williamson.</p>

<p>There is every reason to believe that all these various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">« 125 »</a></span>
and complicated stems belonged to higher and nobler
types of mare&rsquo;s-tails than those of the modern world, and
that their fructification was equisetaceous and of the
form known as <i>Calamostachys</i>.</p>

<p>We have already seen that noble tree-ferns existed in
the Erian period, and these were continued, and their
number and variety greatly extended, in the Carboniferous.
In regard to the structure of their stems, and the
method of supporting these by aërial roots, the tree-ferns
of all ages have been nearly alike, and the form and
structure of the leaves, except in some comparatively rare
and exceptional types, has also been much the same.
Any ordinary observer examining a collection of coal-formation
ferns recognises at once their kinship to the
familiar brackens of our own time. Their fructification
is, unfortunately, rarely preserved, so that we are not
able, in the case of many species, to speak confidently of
their affinities with modern forms; but the knowledge of
this subject has been constantly extending, and a sufficient
amount of information has been obtained to enable
us to say something as to their probable relationships.

<p>The families into which modern ferns are divided are,
it must be confessed, somewhat artificial, and in the case
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">« 126 »</a></span>
of fossil ferns, in which the fructification is for the most
part wanting, it is still more so, depending in great part
on the form and venation of the divisions of the fronds.
Of about eight families into which modern ferns are
divided, seven are found in a fossil state, and of these,
four at least, the <i>Cyathaceæ</i>, the <i>Ophioglosseæ</i>, the <i>Hymenophyllaceæ</i>,
and the <i>Marattiaceæ</i>, go back to the coal-formation.<a name="FNanchor_CD_82" id="FNanchor_CD_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_CD_82" class="fnanchor">[CD]</a></p>

<p>Some of these ferns have the more complex kind of
spore-case, with a jointed, elastic ring. It is to be observed,
however, that those forms which have a simple
spore-case, either netted or membranous, and without
annulus, are most common in the Devonian and lowest
Carboniferous. Some of the forms in these old rocks are
somewhat difficult to place in the system. Of these, the
species of <i>Archæopteris</i>, of the Upper and Middle Erian,
are eminent as examples. This type, however, scarcely
extends as high as the coal-formation.<a name="FNanchor_CE_83" id="FNanchor_CE_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_CE_83" class="fnanchor">[CE]</a> Some of the
tree-ferns of the Carboniferous present very remarkable
features. One of these, of the genus <i>Megaphyton</i>, seems
to have two rows of great leaves, one at each side of the
stem, which was probably sustained by large bundles of
aërial roots (<a href="#fig56">Fig. 56</a>).</p>

<p>In the Carboniferous, as in the Erian, there are leaves
which have been referred to ferns, but are subject to
doubt, as possibly belonging to broad-leaved taxine trees
allied to the gingko-tree of China. One of these, represented
in <a href="#fig57">Fig. 57</a>, has been
found in the coal-formation of
Nova Scotia, and referred to the
doubtful genus <i>Noeggerathia</i>.
Fontaine has proposed for similar
leaves found in Virginia the
new generic name <i>Saportea</i>.</p>

<p>Ferns, as might be inferred
from their great age, are at the
present time dispersed over the
whole world; but their headquarters,
and the regions to
which tree-ferns are confined,
are the more moist climates of the tropics and of the
southern hemisphere. The coal-swamps of the northern
hemisphere seem to have excelled even these favoured
regions of the present world as a paradise for ferns.</p>

<p>I have already stated that the Carboniferous constitutes
the headquarters of the <i>Cordaites</i> (<a href="#fig58">Fig. 58</a>), of which
a large number of species have been described, both in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">« 131 »</a></span>
Europe and America. We sometimes, though rarely,
find their stems showing structure. In this case we have
a large cellular pith, often divided by horizontal partitions
into flat chambers, and constituting the objects
which, when detached, are called <i>Sternbergiæ</i> (<a href="#fig62">Fig. 62</a>).
These Sternbergia piths, however, occur in true conifers
as well, as they do
in the modern world
in some trees, like our
common butternut, of
higher type; and I
showed many years ago
that the Sternbergia
type may be detected
in the young twigs of
the balsam-fir (<i>Abies
balsamifera</i>). The pith
was surrounded by a
ring of scalariform or
barred tissue, often of
considerable thickness,
and in young stems so
important as to have
suggested lycopodiaceous
affinities. But as
the stem grew in size,
a regular ring of woody
wedges, with tissue having
rounded or hexagonal
pores or discs,
like those of pines, was developed. Outside this was a
bark, often apparently of some thickness. This structure
in many important points resembles that of cycads,
and also approaches to the structure of Sigillaria, while
in its more highly developed forms it approximates to
that of the conifers.</p>

<p>On the stems so constructed were placed long and
often broad many-nerved leaves, with rows of stomata or
breathing-pores, and attached by somewhat broad bases
to the stem and branches. The fruit consisted of racemes,
or clusters of nutlets, which seem to have been provided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">« 133 »</a></span>
with broad lateral wings for flotation in the air, or in
some cases with a pulpy envelope, which flattens into a
film. There seem to have been structures of both these
kinds, though in the state of preservation of these curious
seeds it is extremely difficult to distinguish them. In the
first case they must have been intended for dissemination
by the wind, like the seeds of spruces. In the latter case
they may have been disseminated like the fruits of taxine
trees by the agency of animals, though what these were
it would be difficult to guess. These trees had very great
reproductive power, since they produced numerous seeds,
not singly or a few together, as in modern yews, but in
long spikes or catkins bearing many seeds (<a href="#fig59">Fig. 59</a>).</p>

<p>It is to be observed that the Cordaites, or the <i>Cordaitinæ</i>,
as they have been called, as a family,<a name="FNanchor_CF_84" id="FNanchor_CF_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_CF_84" class="fnanchor">[CF]</a> constitute
another of those intermediate groups with which we have
already become familiar. On the one hand they approach
closely to the broader-leaved yews like Gingko, Phyllocladus,
and Podocarpus, and, on the other hand, they
have affinities with Cycadaceæ, and even with Sigillariæ.
They were beautiful and symmetrical trees, adding something
to the variety of the rather monotonous Palæozoic
forests. They contributed also somewhat to the accumulation
of coal. I have found that some thin beds are
almost entirely composed of their leaves, and the tissues
of their wood are not infrequent in the mineral charcoal
of the larger coal-seams. There is no evidence that their
roots were of the stigmaroid type, though they evidently
grew in the same swampy flats with the Sigillariæ and
Calamites.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_CF_84" id="Footnote_CF_84"></a><a href="#FNanchor_CF_84"><span class="label">[CF]</span></a> Engler; Cordaitées of Renault.</p></div>

<p>It may, perhaps, be well to say here that I believe
there was a considerably wide range of organisation in the
Cordaitinæ as well as in the Calamites and Sigillariæ, and
that it will eventually be found that there were three lines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">« 134 »</a></span>
of connection between the higher cryptogams and the
phænogams, one leading from the lycopods by the Sigillariæ,
another leading by the Cordaites, and the third
leading from the Equisetums by the Calamites. Still
further back the characters afterward separated in the
club-mosses, mare&rsquo;s-tails, and ferns, were united in the
Rhizocarps, or, as some now, but I think somewhat unreasonably,
prefer to call them, the &ldquo;heterosporous Filicinæ.&rdquo;
In the more modern world, all the connecting
links have become extinct and the phænogams stand
widely separated from the higher cryptogams. I do not
make these remarks in a Darwinian sense, but merely to
state what appear to be the lines of natural affinity and
the links wanting to give unity to the system of nature.</p>

<p>Of all the trees of the modern world, none are perhaps
so widely distributed as the pines and their allies. On
mountain-tops and within the Arctic zone, the last trees
that can struggle against the unfavourable conditions of
existence are the spruces and firs, and in the warm and
moist islands of the tropics they seem equally at home
with the tree-ferns and the palms. We have already seen
that they are a very ancient family, and in the sandstones
of the coal-formation their great trunks are frequently
found, infiltrated with calcareous or silicious matter, and
still retaining their structure in the greatest perfection
(<a href="#fig60">Fig. 60</a>). So far as we know, the foliage of some of them
which constitutes the genera <i>Walchia</i> and <i>Araucarites</i> of
some authors (Figs. <a href="#fig60">60</a>, <a href="#fig63">63</a>) was not dissimilar from that
of modern yews and spruces, though there is reason to
believe that some others had broad, fern-like leaves like
those of the gingko. None of them, so far as yet certainly
known, were cone-bearing trees, their fruit having
probably been similar to that of the yews (<a href="#fig61">Fig. 61</a>).
The minute structures of their stems are nearer to those
of the conifers of the islands of the southern hemisphere
than to that of those in our northern climes&mdash;a correlation,
no doubt, to the equable climate of the period.
There is not much evidence that they grew with the Sigillariæ
in the true coal-swamps, though some specimens
have been found in this association. It is more likely
that they were in the main inland and upland trees, and
that in consequence they are mostly known to us by
drifted trunks borne by river inundations into the seas
and estuaries.</p>

<p>A remarkable fact in connection with them, and showing
also the manner in which the most durable vegetable
structures may perish by decay, is that, like the Cordaites,
they had large piths with transverse partitions, a structure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">« 137 »</a></span>
which, as I have already mentioned, appears on a
minute scale in the twigs of the fir-tree, and that sometimes
casts of these piths in sandstone appear in a separate
form, constituting what have been named <i>Sternbergiæ</i> or
<i>Artisiæ</i>. As Renault well remarks with reference to
Cordaites, the existence of this chambered form of pith
implies rapid elongation of the stem, so that the Cordaites
and conifers of the coal-formation were probably quickly
growing trees (<a href="#fig62">Fig. 62</a>).</p>

<p>The same general statements may be made as to the
coal-vegetation as in relation to that of the Erian. In
the coal period we have found none of the higher exogens,
and there are only obscure and uncertain indications
of the presence of endogens, which we may reserve
for a future chapter; but gymnosperms abound and are
highly characteristic. On the other hand, we have no
mosses or lichens, and very few Algæ, but a great number
of ferns and Lycopodiaceæ or club-mosses (<a href="#fig63">Fig. 63</a>).
Thus, the coal-formation period is botanically a meeting-place
of the lower phænogams and the higher cryptogams,
and presents many forms which, when imperfectly known,
have puzzled botanists in regard to their position in one
or other series. In the present world, the flora most akin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">« 138 »</a></span>
to that of the coal period is that of warm, temperate regions
in the southern hemisphere. It is not properly a
tropical flora, nor is it the flora of a cold region, but
rather indicative of a moist and equable climate. Still,
we must bear in mind that we may often be mistaken in
reasoning as to the temperature required by extinct
species of plants, differing from those now in existence.
Further, we must not assume that the climatal conditions
of the northern hemisphere were in the coal period at all
similar to those which now prevail. As Sir Charles Lyell
has shown, a less amount of land in the higher latitudes
would greatly modify climates, and there is every reason
to believe that in the coal period there was less land than
now. Further, it has been shown by Tyndall that a very
small additional amount of carbonic acid in the atmosphere
would, by obstructing the radiation of heat from
the earth, produce almost the effect of a glass roof or conservatory,
extending over the whole world. Again, there
is much in the structure of the leaves of the coal-plants,
as well as in the vast amount of carbon which they accumulated
in the form of coal, and the characteristics of
the animal life of the period, to indicate, on independent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">« 139 »</a></span>
grounds, that the carboniferous atmosphere differed from
that of the present world in this way, or in the presence
of more carbonic acid&mdash;a substance now existing in the
very minute proportion of one thousandth of the whole&mdash;a
quantity adapted to the present requirements of vegetable
and animal life, but probably not to those of the
coal period.</p>

</div>

<p>Thus, if we inquire as to any analogous distribution of
plants in the modern world, we find this only in the warmer
insular climates of the southern hemisphere, where
ferns, lycopods, and pines appear under forms somewhat
akin to those of the Carboniferous, but mixed with
other types, some of which are modern, others allied to
those of the next succeeding geological ages of the Mesozoic
and Tertiary; and under these periods it will be
more convenient to make comparisons.</p>

<p>The readers of recent English popular works on geology
will have observed the statement reiterated that a
large proportion of the material of the great beds of bituminous
coal is composed of the spore-cases of lycopodiaceous
plants&mdash;a statement quite contrary to that resulting
from my microscopical examinations of the coal
of more than eighty coal-beds in Nova Scotia and Cape
Breton, as stated in &ldquo;Acadian Geology&rdquo; (page 463), and
more fully in my memoir of 1858 on the &ldquo;Structures in
Coal,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_CG_85" id="FNanchor_CG_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_CG_85" class="fnanchor">[CG]</a> and that of 1866, on the &ldquo;Conditions of Accumulation
of Coal.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_CH_86" id="FNanchor_CH_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_CH_86" class="fnanchor">[CH]</a> The reason of this mistake is,
that an eminent English naturalist, happening to find in
certain specimens of English coal a great quantity of remains
of spores and spore-cases, though even in his specimens
they constitute only a small portion of the mass,
and being apparently unacquainted with what others had
done in this field, wrote a popular article for the &ldquo;Contemporary
Review,&rdquo; in which he extended an isolated and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">« 140 »</a></span>
exceptional fact to all coals, and placed this supposed
origin of coal in a light so brilliant and attractive that he
has been followed by many recent writers. The fact is,
as stated in &ldquo;Acadian Geology,&rdquo; that trunks of <i>Sigillariæ</i>
and similar trees constitute a great part of the denser
portion of the coal, and that the cortical tissues of these
rather than the wood remain as coal. But cortical or
epidermal tissues in general, whether those of spore-cases
or other parts of plants, are those which from their resistance
to water-soakage and to decay, and from their
highly carbonaceous character, are best suited to the production
of coal. In point of fact, spore-cases, though
often abundantly present, constitute only an infinitesimal
part of the matter of the great coal-beds. In an article
in &ldquo;The American Journal of Science,&rdquo; which appeared
shortly after that above referred to, I endeavoured to correct
this error, though apparently without effect in so far
as the majority of British geological writers are concerned.
From this article I have taken with little change
the following passages, as it is of importance in theoretical
geology that such mistakes, involving as they do the
whole theory of coal accumulation, should not continue
to pass current. The early part of the paper is occupied
with facts as to the occurrence of spores and spore-cases as
partial ingredients in coal. Its conclusions are as follows:
It is not improbable that sporangites, or bodies resembling
them, may be found in most coals; but it
is most likely that their occurrence is accidental rather
than essential to coal accumulation, and that they are
more likely to have been abundant in shales and cannel
coals, deposited in ponds or in shallow waters in the vicinity
of lycopodiaceous forests, than in the swampy
or peaty deposits which constitute the ordinary coals.
It is to be observed, however, that the conspicuous appearance
which these bodies, and also the strips and
fragments of epidermal tissue, which resemble them in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">« 141 »</a></span>
texture, present in slices of coal, may incline an observer,
not having large experience in the examination of coals,
to overrate their importance; and this I think has been
done by most microscopists, especially those who have
confined their attention to slices prepared by the lapidary.
One must also bear in mind the danger arising from mistaking
concretionary accumulations of bituminous matter
for sporangia. In sections of the bituminous shales accompanying
the Devonian coal above mentioned, there
are many rounded yellow spots, which on examination
prove to be the spaces in the epidermis of <i>Psilophyton</i>
through which the vessels passing to the leaves were
emitted. To these considerations I would add the following,
condensed from the paper above referred to
(<a href="#Page_139">p. 139</a>), in which the whole question of the origin of
coal is fully discussed:<a name="FNanchor_CI_87" id="FNanchor_CI_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_CI_87" class="fnanchor">[CI]</a></p>

<p>1. The mineral charcoal or &lsquo;mother coal&rsquo; is obviously
woody tissue and fibres of bark, the structure of the varieties
of which, and the plants to which it probably belongs,
I have discussed in the paper above mentioned.</p>

<p>2. The coarser layers of coal show under the microscope
a confused mass of fragments of vegetable matter
belonging to various descriptions of plants, and including,
but not usually in large quantities, sporangites.</p>

<p>3. The more brilliant layers of the coal are seen,
when separated by thin laminæ of clay, to have on their
surfaces the markings of <i>Sigillariæ</i> and other trees, of
which they evidently represent flattened specimens, or
rather the bark of such specimens. Under the microscope,
when their structures are preserved, these layers
show cortical tissues more abundantly than any others.</p>

<p>4. Some thin layers of coal consist mainly of flattened
layers of leaves of <i>Cordaites</i> or <i>Pychnophyllum</i>.</p>

<p>5. The <i>Stigmaria</i> under-clays and the stumps of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">« 142 »</a></span>
<i>Sigillaria</i> in the coal-roofs equally testify to the accumulation
of coal by the growth of successive forests, more
especially of <i>Sigillariæ</i>. There is, on the other hand, no
necessary connection of sporangite-beds with Stigmarian
soils. Such beds are more likely to be accumulated in
water, and consequently to constitute bituminous shales
and cannels.</p>

<p>6. <i>Lepidodendron</i> and its allies, to which the spore-cases
in question appear to belong, are evidently much
less important to coal accumulation than <i>Sigillaria</i>, which
cannot be affirmed to have produced spore-cases similar
to those in question, even though the observation of
Goldenberg as to their fruit can be relied on; the accuracy
of which, however, I am inclined to doubt.</p>

<p>On the whole, then, while giving due credit to those
who have advocated the spore-theory of coal, for directing
attention to this curious and no doubt important constituent
of mineral fuel, and admitting that I may possibly
have given too little attention to it, I must maintain that
sporangite-beds are exceptional among coals, and that
cortical and woody matters are the most abundant ingredients
in all the ordinary kinds; and to this I cannot
think that the coals of England constitute an exception.</p>

<p>It is to be observed, in conclusion, that the spore-cases
of plants, in their indestructibility and richly carbonaceous
character, only partake of qualities common to
most suberous and epidermal matters, as I have explained
in the publications already referred to. Such epidermal
and cortical substances are extremely rich in carbon and
hydrogen, in this resembling bituminous coal. They are
also very little liable to decay, and they resist more than
other vegetable matters aqueous infiltration&mdash;properties
which have caused them to remain unchanged, and to
continue free from mineral additions more than other
vegetable tissues. These qualities are well seen in the
bark of our American white birch. It is no wonder that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">« 143 »</a></span>
materials of this kind should constitute considerable
portions of such vegetable accumulations as the beds of
coal, and that when present in large proportion they
should afford richly bituminous beds. All this agrees
with the fact, apparent on examination of the common
coal, that the greater number of its purest layers consist
of the flattened bark of <i>Sigillariæ</i> and similar trees, just
as any single flattened trunk embedded in shale becomes
a layer of pure coal. It also agrees with the fact that
other layers of coal, and also the cannels and earthy
bitumens, appear under the microscope to consist of
finely comminuted particles, principally of epidermal tissues,
not only from the fruits and spore-cases of plants,
but also from their leaves and stems. These considerations
impress us, just as much as the abundance of spore-cases,
with the immense amount of the vegetable matter
which has perished during the accumulation of coal, in
comparison with that which has been preserved.</p>

<p>I am indebted to Dr. T. Sterry Hunt for the following
very valuable information, which at once places
in a clear and precise light the chemical relations of
epidermal tissue and spores with coal. Dr. Hunt says:
"The outer bark of the cork-tree, and the cuticle of
many if not all other plants, consists of a highly carbonaceous
matter, to which the name of <i>suberin</i> has been
given. The spores of <i>Lycopodium</i> also approach to this
substance in composition, as will be seen by the following,
one of two analyses by Duconi,<a name="FNanchor_CJ_88" id="FNanchor_CJ_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_CJ_88" class="fnanchor">[CJ]</a> along with which
I give the theoretical composition of pure cellulose or

<p>&ldquo;It will be seen from this comparison that, in ultimate
composition, cork and <i>Lycopodium</i> are nearer to
lignite than to woody fibre, and may be converted into
coal with far less loss of carbon and hydrogen than the
latter. They in fact approach closer in composition to
resins and fats than to wood, and, moreover, like those
substances repel water, with which they are not easily
moistened, and thus are able to resist those atmospheric
influences which effect the decay of woody tissue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I would add to this only one further consideration.
The nitrogen present in the <i>Lycopodium</i> spores, no doubt,
belongs to the protoplasm contained in them, a substance
which would soon perish by decay; and subtracting this,
the cell-walls of the spores and the walls of the spore-cases
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">« 145 »</a></span>
would be most suitable material for the production
of bituminous coal. But this suitableness they share with
the epidermal tissue of the scales of strobiles, and of the
stems and leaves of ferns and lycopods, and, above all,
with the thick, corky envelope of the stems of <i>Sigillariæ</i>
and similar trees, which, as I have elsewhere shown,<a name="FNanchor_CM_91" id="FNanchor_CM_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_CM_91" class="fnanchor">[CM]</a>
from its condition in the prostrate and erect trunks contained
in the beds associated with coal, must have been
highly carbonaceous and extremely enduring and impermeable
to water. In short, if, instead of &ldquo;spore-cases,&rdquo;
we read &ldquo;epidermal tissues in general, including spore-cases,&rdquo;
all that has been affirmed regarding the latter will
be strictly and literally true, and in accordance with the
chemical composition, microscopical characters, and mode
of occurrence of coal. It will also be in accordance with
the following statement, from my paper on the &ldquo;Structures
in Coal,&rdquo; published in 1859:</p>

<div class="footnote">

xv., 626. &ldquo;Conditions of Accumulation of Coal,&rdquo; <i>ibid.</i>, xxii., 95. &ldquo;Acadian
Geology,&rdquo; 197, 464.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;A single trunk of <i>Sigillaria</i> in an erect forest presents
an epitome of a coal-seam. Its roots represent the
<i>Stigmaria</i> under-clay; its bark the compact coal; its
woody axis the mineral charcoal; its fallen leaves (and
fruits), with remains of herbaceous plants growing in its
shade, mixed with a little earthy matter, the layers of
coarse coal. The condition of the durable outer bark of
erect trees concurs with the chemical theory of coal, in
showing the especial suitableness of this kind of tissue for
the production of the purer compact coals. It is also
probable that the comparative impermeability of the bark
to mineral infiltration is of importance in this respect,
enabling this material to remain unaffected by causes
which have filled those layers, consisting of herbaceous
materials and decayed wood, with pyrites and other mineral
substances.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">« 146 »</a></span></p>

<p>We need not go far in search of the uses of the coal
vegetation, when .we consider the fact that the greatest
civilised nations are dependent on it for their fuel. Without
the coal of the Carboniferous period and the iron-ore
which is one of the secondary consequences of coal accumulation,
just as bog-ores of iron occur in the subsoils
of modern peats, it would have been impossible either to
sustain great nations in comfort in the colder climates of
the northern hemisphere or to carry on our arts and
manufactures. The coal-formation yields to Great Britain
alone about one hundred and sixty million tons of
coal annually, and the miners of the United States extract
mainly from the same formation nearly a hundred
million tons, while the British colonies and dependencies
produce about five million tons; and it is a remarkable
fact that it is to the English race that the
greatest supply of this buried power and heat and light
has been given.</p>

<p>The great forests of the coal period, while purifying
the atmosphere of its excess of unwholesome carbonic
acid, were storing up the light and heat of Palæozoic
summers in a form in which they could be recovered in our
human age, so that, independently of their uses to the
animals which were their contemporaries, they are indispensable
to the existence of civilised man.</p>

<p>Nor can we hope soon to be able to dispense with the
services of this accumulated store of fuel. The forests
of to-day are altogether insufficient for the supply of our
wants, and though we are beginning to apply water-power
to the production of electricity, and though some promising
plans have been devised for the utilisation of the
direct heat and light of the sun, we are still quite as dependent
as any of our predecessors on what has been done
for us in the Palæozoic age.</p>

<p>In the previous pages I have said little respecting the
physical geography of the Carboniferous age; but, as may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">« 147 »</a></span>
be inferred from the vegetation, this in the northern
hemisphere presented a greater expanse of swampy flats
little elevated above the sea than we find in any other period.
As to the southern hemisphere, less is known, but
the conditions of vegetation would seem to have been essentially
the same.</p>

<p>Taking the southern hemisphere as a whole, I have
not seen any evidence of a Lower Devonian or Upper Silurian
flora; but in South Africa and Australia there are
remains of Upper Devonian or Lower Carboniferous
plants. These were succeeded by a remarkable Upper
Carboniferous or Permian group, which spread itself all
over India, Australia, and South Africa,<a name="FNanchor_CN_92" id="FNanchor_CN_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_CN_92" class="fnanchor">[CN]</a> and contains
some forms (<i>Vertebraria</i>, <i>Phyllotheca</i>, <i>Glossopteris</i>, &amp;c. )
not found in rocks of similar age in the northern hemisphere,
so that, if the age of these beds has been correctly
determined, the southern hemisphere was in advance in
relation to some genera of plants. This, however, is to
be expected when we consider that the Triassic and Jurassic
flora of the north contains or consists of intruders
from more southern sites. These beds are succeeded in
India by others holding cycads, &amp;c., of Upper Jurassic
or Lower Cretaceous types (Rajmahal and Jabalpur
groups).</p>

<p>Blanford has shown that there is a very great similarity
in this series all over the Australian and Indian region.<a name="FNanchor_CO_93" id="FNanchor_CO_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_CO_93" class="fnanchor">[CO]</a>
Hartt and Darby have in like manner distinguished
Devonian and Carboniferous forms in Brazil akin
to those of the northern hemisphere. Thus the southern
hemisphere would seem to have kept pace with the northern,
and according to Blanford there is evidence there of
cold conditions in the Permian, separating the Palæozoic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">« 148 »</a></span>
flora from that of the Mesozoic, in the same manner that
Ramsay has supposed a similar period of cold to have done
north of the equator. This would imply a very great
change of climate, since we have evidence of the extension
of the Lower Carboniferous flora at least as far
north as Spitzbergen. The upper coal-formation we
cannot, however, trace nearly so far north; so that a
gradual refrigeration may have been going on before
the Permian. Thus in both hemispheres there was a
general similarity in the later Palæozoic flora, and perhaps
similar conditions leading to its extinction and to
its replacement by that to be described in the next
chapter.</p>

only foliage associated with them is of the type of <i>Walchia</i> and
<i>Araucarites</i>&mdash;viz., slender branches with numerous small spiral acicular
leaves. Two of the coal-formation species, <i>D. materiarum</i> and

<p><a name="Footnote_CP_94" id="Footnote_CP_94"></a><a href="#FNanchor_CP_94"><span class="label">[CP]</span></a> &ldquo;Geological Survey of Canada: Fossil Plants of Erian and Upper
Silurian Formations,&rdquo; by J. W. Dawson.</p></div>

<p>All of the above can be vouched for as good species based upon
microscopic examination of a very large number of trunks from different
parts of North America. The three Erian species of <i>Dadoxylon</i>
and <i>D. antiquius</i> from the Lower Carboniferous have two or more
rows of cells in the medullary rays. The last named has several
rows, and is a true <i>Palæoxylon</i> allied to <i>D. Withami</i> of Great
Britain. <i>D. materiarium</i> is specially characteristic of the upper
coal-formation and Permian, and to it must belong one or both of
the species of foliage indicated above. <i>D. Clarkii</i> has very short,
simple medullary rays of only a few cells superimposed, and has an
inner cylinder of scalariform vessels, approaching in these points to
<i>Cordaites</i>. <i>Ormoxylon</i> has a very peculiar articulated pith and
simple medullary rays.</p>

<p>Witham in 1833 described several Carboniferous species of pine-wood,
under the generic name Pinites, separating under the name
<i>Pitus</i> species which appeared to have the discs on the cell-walls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">« 150 »</a></span>
separate and in transverse lines. Witham&rsquo;s name was changed by
Goeppert to <i>Araucarites</i>, to indicate the similarity of these woods to
Araucaria, <i>Pinites</i> being reserved for trees more closely allied to the
ordinary pines. Endlicher, restricting Araucarites to foliage, etc.,
of Araucaria-like trees, gave the name <i>Dadoxylon</i> to the wood; and
this, through Unger&rsquo;s &ldquo;Genera and Species,&rdquo; has gained somewhat
general acceptance. Endlicher also gave the name <i>Pissadendron</i> to
the species which Witham had called <i>Pitus</i>; but Brongniart proposed
the name <i>Palæoxylon</i> to include all the species with thick
and complex medullary rays, whatever the arrangement of the discs.
In Schimper&rsquo;s new work Kraus substitutes <i>Araucarioxylon</i> for Endlicher&rsquo;s
<i>Dadoxylon</i>, and includes under <i>Pissadendron</i> all the species
placed by Brongniart in <i>Palæoxylon</i>.</p>

<p>To understand all this confusion, it may be observed that the
characters available in the determination of Palæozoic coniferous
wood are chiefly the form and arrangement of the wood-cells, the
character of the bordered pores or discs of their walls, and the form
and composition of the medullary rays.</p>

<p>The character on which Witham separated his genus <i>Pitus</i> from
<i>Pinites</i> is, as I have ascertained by examination of slices of one of
his original specimens kindly presented to me by Mr. Sanderson, of
Edinburgh, dependent on state of preservation, the imperfectly preserved
discs or areolations of the walls of the fibre presenting the
appearance of separate and distinct circles, while in other parts of
the same specimens these discs are seen to be contiguous and to assume
hexagonal forms, so that in this respect they do not really
differ from the ordinary species of <i>Dadoxylon</i>. The true character
for subdividing those species which are especially characteristic of
the Carboniferous, is the composite structure of the medullary rays,
which are thick and composed of several radial piles of cells placed
side by side. This was the character employed by Brongniart in
separating the genus <i>Palæoxylon</i>, though he might with convenience
have retained Witham&rsquo;s name, merely transferring to the genus the
species of Witham&rsquo;s <i>Pinites</i> which have complex medullary rays.
The Erian rocks present the greatest variety of types, and <i>Palæoxylon</i>
is especially characteristic of the Lower Carboniferous, while species
of <i>Dadoxylon</i> with two rows of bordered pores and simple medullary
rays are especially plentiful in the upper coal-formation and Permo-Carboniferous.</p>

<p>The following table will clearly show the distinctive characters
and relations of the genera in question, as held by the several authors
above referred to:</p>

<p>Trunks marked by transverse scars of attachment of bases of
leaves; leaves broad, with many parallel veins, and attached by a
broad base; pistillate and staminate catkins of the nature of Antholithes.
Fruit winged or pulpy, of the kind known as <i>Cardiocarpum</i>.
Stem with a Sternbergia pith, usually large, surrounded by
a ring of pseudo-scalariform vessels, and with a cylinder usually
narrow, of woody wedges, with bordered pores in one or more series,
and with simple medullary rays.</p>

<p>From specimens kindly presented to me by Prof. Renault, I
have been able to ascertain that the stems of some at least of these
plants (Eucordaites) are distinct in structure from all the species of
<i>Dadoxylon</i>, above mentioned, except <i>D. Clarkii</i>, of the Erian. They
may be regarded as intermediate between those of conifers and
cycads, which is indeed the probable position of these remarkable
plants.</p>

<p>Grand d&rsquo;Eury has divided the <i>Cordaites</i> into sub-genera, as follows:</p>

<p>1. <i>Eucordaites.</i>&mdash;Leaves spatulate, obovate, elliptical, or lanceolate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">« 152 »</a></span>
sessile, entire, with rounded apices and of leathery consistency.
The leaves are from twenty to ninety centimetres in
length. The nerves are either equally or unequally strong.</p>

<p>2. <i>Dorycordaites.</i>&mdash;Leaves lanceolate, with sharp points; nerves
numerous, fine, and equal in strength. The leaves attain a length
of from forty to fifty centimetres.</p>

<p>3. <i>Poacordaites.</i>&mdash;Leaves narrow, linear, entire, blunt at the
point, with nerves nearly equally strong. The leaves are as much
as forty centimetres in length.</p>

<p>To these Renault and Zeiller have added a fourth group, <i>Scutocordaites</i>.</p>

<p class="caption4"><i>Genus</i> <span class="smcap">Sternbergia</span>.</p>

<p>This is merely a provisional genus intended to receive casts of
the pith cylinders of various fossil trees. Their special peculiarity
is that, as in the modern <i>Cecropia peltata</i>, and some species of <i>Ficus</i>,
the pith consists of transverse dense partitions which, on the elongation
of the internodes, become separated from each other, so as to
produce a chambered pith cavity, the cast of which shows transverse
furrows. The young twigs of the modern <i>Abies balsamifera</i> present
a similar structure on a minute scale. I have ascertained and
described such pith-cylinders in large stems of <i>Dadoxylon Ouangondianum</i>,
and <i>D. materiarium</i>. They occur also in the stems of
<i>Cordaites</i> and probably of <i>Sigillariæ</i>. I have discussed these curious
fossils at length in &ldquo;Acadian Geology&rdquo; and in the &ldquo;Journal of
the Geological Society of London,&rdquo; 1860. The following summary
is from the last-mentioned paper:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> As Prof. Williamson and the writer have shown, many of
the <i>Sternbergia</i> piths belong to coniferous trees of the genus <i>Dadoxylon</i>.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> A few specimens present multiporous tissue, of the type of
<i>Dictyoxylon</i>, a plant of unknown affinities, and which, according to
Williamson, has a <i>Sternbergia</i> pith.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Other examples show a true scalariform tissue, comparable
with that of <i>Lepidodendron</i> or <i>Sigillaria</i>, but of finer texture. Corda
has shown that plants of the type of the former genus (his <i>Lomatophloios</i>)
had <i>Sternbergia</i> piths. Some plants of this group are by
external characters loosely reckoned by botanists as ribless <i>Sigillariæ</i>
(<i>Clathraria</i>); but I believe that they are not related even ordinally
to that genus.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Many Carboniferous <i>Sternbergiæ</i> show structures identical
with those described above as occurring in <i>Cordaites</i>, and also in
some of the trees ordinarily reckoned as <i>Sigillariæ</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">« 153 »</a></span></p>

<p class="caption4"><i>Genus</i> <span class="smcap">Cardiocarpum</span>.</p>

<p>I have found at least eight species of these fruits in the Erian
and Carboniferous of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, all of which
are evidently fruits of gymnospermous trees. They agree in having
a dense coaly nucleus of appreciable thickness, even in the
flattened specimens, and surrounded by a thin and veinless wing or
margin. They have thus precisely the appearance of samaras of
many existing forest-trees, some of which they also resemble in the
outline of the margin, except that the wings of samaras are usually
veiny. The character of the nucleus, and the occasional appearance
in it of marks possibly representing cotyledons or embryos, forbids
the supposition that they are spore-cases. They must have been
fruits of phænogams. Whether they were winged fruits or seeds,
or fruits with a pulpy envelope like those of cycads and some
conifers, may be considered less certain. The not infrequent distortion
of the margin is an argument in favour of the latter view,
though this may also be supposed to have occurred in samaras partially
decayed. On the other hand, their being always apparently
flattened in one plane, and the nucleus being seldom, if ever, found
denuded of its margin, are arguments in favour of their having been
winged nutlets or seeds. Until recently I had regarded the latter
view as more probable, and so stated the matter in the second edition
of &ldquo;Acadian Geology.&rdquo; I have, however, lately arrived at the
conclusion that the <i>Cardiocarpa</i> of the type of <i>C. cornutum</i> were
gymnospermous seeds, having two cotyledons embedded in an albumen
and covered with a strong membranous or woody tegmen surrounded
by a fleshy outer coat, and that the notch at the apex represents
the foramen or micropyle of the ovule. The structure was
indeed very similar to that of the seeds of <i>Taxus</i> and of <i>Salisburia</i>.
With respect to some of the other species, however, especially those
with very broad margins, it still appears likely that they were winged.</p>

<p>The <i>Cardiocarpa</i> were borne in racemes or groups, and it seems
certain that some of them at least are the seeds of <i>Cordaites</i>. The
association of some of them and of those of the next genus with
<i>Sigillariæ</i> is so constant that I cannot doubt that some of them
belong to plants of that genus, or possibly to taxine conifers. The
great number of distinct species of these seeds, as compared with
that of known trees which could have produced them, is very remarkable.</p>

<p class="caption4"><i>Genus</i> <span class="smcap">Trigonocarpum</span>.</p>

<p>These are large angled nuts contained in a thick envelope, and
showing internal structures resembling those of the seeds of modern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">« 154 »</a></span>
<i>Taxineæ</i>. There are numerous species, as well as allied seeds referred
to the provisional genera <i>Rhabdocarpus</i> and <i>Carpolithes</i>.
In <i>Trigonocarpum Hookeri</i> I have described the internal structure
of one of those seeds, and many fine examples from the coal-field of
St. Etienne, in France, have been described by Brongniart, so that
their internal structure is very well known.</p>

<p><i>Genus</i> Antholithes.</p>

<p>This is also a provisional genus, to include spikes of floral
organs, some of which are known to have belonged to <i>Cordaites</i>,
others probably to <i>Sigillariæ</i>.</p>

<p class="caption4"><i>Family</i> <span class="smcap">Sigillariaceæ</span>.</p>

<p>Under this name palæobotanists have included a great number
of trees of the Carboniferous system, all of which are characterised
by broad leaf-sears, with three vascular scars, and usually arranged
in vertical rows, and by elongated three-nerved leaves, and roots of
the stigmaria type&mdash;that is, with rounded pits, marking the attachment
of rootlets spirally arranged. These trees, however, collected
in the genus Sigillaria by arbitrary characters, which pass into
those of the Lepidodendroid trees, have been involved in almost inextricable
confusion, to disentangle which it will be necessary to consider:
1. The external characters of <i>Sigillariæ</i>, and trees confounded
with them. 2. Subdivision of <i>Sigillariæ</i> by external markings. 3.
The microscopic character of their stems. 4. What is known of
their foliage and fruit.</p>

<p>1. <i>Characters of Sigillaroid and Lepidodendroid Trunks</i>.</p>

<p>It may be premised that the modes of determination in fossil
botany are necessarily different from those employed in recent botany.
The palæobotanist must have recourse to characters derived
from the leaves, the scars left by their fall, and the internal structures
of the stem. These parts, held in little esteem by botanists in
describing modern plants, and much neglected by them, must hold
the first place in the regard of the fossil botanist, whereas the fructification,
seldom preserved, and generally obscure, is of comparatively
little service. It is to be remarked also that in such generalised
plants as those of the Palæozoic, remarkable rather for the development
of the vegetative than of the reproductive organs, the
former rise in importance as compared with their value in the study
of modern plants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">« 155 »</a></span></p>

<p>In <i>Sigillariæ</i>, <i>Lepidodendra</i>, &amp;c., the following surfaces of the
stem may be presented to our inspection:</p>

<p>1. The outer surface of the epidermis without its leaves, but
with the leaf-bases and leaf-scars more or less perfectly preserved.
On this surface we may recognise: (1) Cellular swellings or projections
of the bark to which the leaves are attached. These may be
called leaf-bases, and they are sometimes very prominent. (2) The
actual mark of the attachment of the leaf situated in the most
prominent part of the leaf-base. This is the <i>leaf-scar</i>. (3) In the
leaf-scar when well preserved we can see one or more minute punctures
or prominences which are the points where the vascular bundles
passing to the leaf found exit. These are the vascular scars.</p>

<p>When the leaves are attached, the leaf-scars and vascular scars
cannot be seen, but the leaf-bases can be made out. Hence it is
important, if possible, to secure specimens with and without the
leaves. In flattened specimens the leaf-bases are often distorted by
pressure and marked with furrows which must not be mistaken for
true structural characters. The leaf-bases, which are in relief on the
outer surface of the stem, of course appear as depressions on the
mould in the containing rock, in which the markings often appear
much more distinctly than on the plant itself.</p>

<p>2. The outer surface of the epidermis may have been removed or
may be destroyed by the coarseness of the containing rock. In this
case the leaf-bases are usually preserved on the surface of the outer
or corky bark, but the leaf-scars and vascular scars have disappeared.
This gives that condition of Lepidodendroid trees to which the name
<i>Knorria</i> has been applied. When plants are in this state careful inspection
may sometimes discover traces of the leaf-scars on portions
of the stem, and thus enable the <i>Knorria</i> to be connected with the
species to which it belongs.</p>

<p>3. The outer or corky bark may be removed, exposing the surface
of the inner or fibrous and cellular bark, which in the plants in
question is usually of great thickness. In this case neither the leaf-bases
nor the scars are seen, but punctures or little furrows or ridges
appear where the vascular bundles entered the inner bark. Specimens
in this state are usually said to be decorticated, though only
the outer bark is removed. It is often difficult to determine plants
in this condition, unless some portion of the stem can be found still
retaining the bark; but when care is taken in collecting, it will not
infrequently be found that the true outer surface can be recovered
from the containing rock, especially if a coaly layer representing the
outer bark intervenes between this and the inner impression. Specimens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">« 156 »</a></span>
of this kind, taken alone, have been referred to the genera
<i>Knorria</i>, <i>Bothrodendron</i>, and <i>Halonia</i>.</p>

<p>4. In some cases, though not frequently, the outer surface of the
ligneous cylinder is preserved. It almost invariably presents a
regularly striated or irregularly wrinkled appearance, depending
upon the vertical woody wedges, or the positions of the medullary
rays or vascular bundles. Specimens of this kind constituted some
of the <i>Endogenites</i> of the older botanists, and the genus <i>Schizodendron</i>
of Eichwald appears to include some of them. Many of them
have also been incorrectly referred to Calamites.</p>

<p>5. In some cases the cast of the medullary cylinder or pith may
alone be preserved. This may be nearly smooch or slightly marked
by vertical striæ, but more usually presents a transverse striation,
and not infrequently the transverse constrictions and septa characteristic
of the genus Sternbergia. Loose <i>Sternbergiæ</i> afford little
means of connecting them with the species to which they belong,
except by the microscopic examination of the shreds of the ligneous
cylinder which often cling to them.<a name="FNanchor_CS_97" id="FNanchor_CS_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_CS_97" class="fnanchor">[CS]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_CS_97" id="Footnote_CS_97"></a><a href="#FNanchor_CS_97"><span class="label">[CS]</span></a> See my paper, &ldquo;Journal of Geological Society,&rdquo; vol. xxvii.</p></div>

<p>These facts being premised, the following general statements
may be made respecting some of the more common Palæozoic genera,
referring, however, principally to the perfect markings as seen on
the epidermis:</p>

<p><i>Sigillaria.</i>&mdash;Leaf-bases hexagonal or elongated, or confluent on
a vertical ridge. Leaf-scars hexagonal or shield-shaped. Vascular
scars three, the two lateral larger than the central. This last character
is constant, depending on the fact that the leaves of Sigillaria
have two or more vascular bundles. All so-called <i>Sigillariæ</i> having
the central vascular scar largest, or only one vascular bundle, should
be rejected from this genus. In young branches of branching <i>Sigillariæ</i>
the leaf-scars sometimes appear to be spiral, but in the older
stems they form vertical rows; interrupted, however, by transverse
rows or bands of <i>fruit-scars</i>, each with a single large central vascular
scar, and which have borne the organs of fructification. <i>Arthrocaulis</i>
of McCoy is founded on this peculiarity.</p>

<p><i>Syringodendron.</i>&mdash;Differs from Sigillaria in the leaf-scars, which
are circular and with a single vascular bundle. It is a matter of
doubt whether these plants were of higher rank than Sigillaria
tending toward the pines, or of lower rank tending toward Cyclostigma.
Their leaf-bases form vertical ridges.</p>

<p><i>Lepidodendron.</i>&mdash;Leaf-bases rhombic, oval, or lanceolate, moderately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">« 157 »</a></span>
prominent. Leaf-scars rhombic or sometimes shield-shaped or
heart-shaped, in the middle or upper part of the leaf-base. Vascular
scars three&mdash;the middle one always largest and corresponding to the
single nerve of the leaf; the lateral ones sometimes obsolete.</p>

<p>In older stems three modes of growth are observed. In some
species the expansion of the bark obliterates the leaf-bases and
causes the leaf-scars to appear separated by wide spaces of more or
less wrinkled bark, which at length becomes longitudinally furrowed
and simulates the ribbed character of Sigillaria. In others the leaf-bases
grow in size as the trunk expands, so that even in large trunks
they are contiguous though much larger than those on the branches.
In others the outer bark, hardening at an early age, is incapable of
either of the above changes, and merely becomes cleft into deep furrows
in the old trunks.</p>

<p><i>Lepidophloios.</i>&mdash;Leaf-bases transverse and prominent&mdash;often
very much so. Leaf-scars transversely rhombic or oval with three
vascular scars, the central largest. Leaves very long and one-nerved.
Large strobiles or branchlets borne in two ranks or spirally
on the sides of the stem, and leaving large, round scars (<i>cone-scars</i>),
often with radiating impressions of the basal row of scales.</p>

<p>Species with long or drooping leaf-bases have been included in
<i>Lepidophloios</i> and <i>Lomatophloios</i>, Species with short leaf-bases and
cone-scars in two rows have been called <i>Ulodendron</i>, and some of
them have been included in Sigillaria (sub-genus <i>Clathraria</i>). Decorticated
stems are Bothrodendron and <i>Halonia</i>. Some of the
species approach near to the last genus, especially to the Lepidodendra
with rhombic leaf-bases like <i>L. tetragonum</i>.</p>

<p><i>Cyclostigma.</i>&mdash;Leaf-bases undeveloped. Leaf-scars circular or
horseshoe-shaped, small, with a central vascular scar. In old trunks
of Cyclostigma the leaf-scars become widely separated, and sometimes
appear in vertical rows. Young branches of Lepidodendron
sometimes have the leaf-scars similar to those of Cyclostigma.</p>

<p><i>Leptophleum.</i>&mdash;Leaf-bases flat, rhombic; leaf-scars obsolete;
vascular scar single, central. The last two genera are characteristically
Devonian.</p>

<p>In contradistinction from the trees above mentioned, the following
general statements may be made respecting other groups:</p>

<p>In conifers the leaf-bases are usually elongated vertically, often
scaly in appearance, and with the leaf-scar terminal and round, oval,
or rhombic, and with a single well-marked vascular scar.</p>

<p>In Calamites, Calamodendron, and Asterophyllites the scars of
the branchlets or leaves are circular or oval, with only a single vascular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">« 158 »</a></span>
scar, and situated in verticils at the top of well-marked nodes
of the stem.</p>

<p>In tree-ferns the leaf-bases are large and usually without a distinct
articulating surface. The vascular bundles are numerous.
Protopteris has rounded leaf-scars with a large horseshoe-shaped
bundle of vessels above and small bundles below. Caulopteris has
large elliptic or oval leaf-scars with vascular scars disposed concentrically.
Palæopteris,<a name="FNanchor_CT_98" id="FNanchor_CT_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_CT_98" class="fnanchor">[CT]</a> of Geinitz, has the leaf-scars transversely
oval and the vascular bundles confluent in a transverse band with an
appendage or outlying bundle below. Stemmatopteris has leaf-scars
similar to those of Caulopteris, but the vascular bundles united
into a horseshoe-shaped band.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_CT_98" id="Footnote_CT_98"></a><a href="#FNanchor_CT_98"><span class="label">[CT]</span></a> This name, preoccupied by Geinitz, has been inadvertently misapplied
to the Devonian ferns of the genus <i>Archæopteris</i>.</p></div>


<p>2. <i>Subdivision of Sigillariæ in Accordance with their Markings</i>.</p>

<p>The following groups may be defined in this way; but, being
based on one character only, they are of course in all probability far
from natural:</p>

<p>1. <i>Sigillaria</i>, Brongniart. Type, <i>Sigillaria reniformis</i>, Brongniart,
or <i>S. Brounii</i>, Dawson.&mdash;Stem with broad ribs, usually much
broader than the usually oval or elliptical tripunctate areoles, but
disappearing at base, owing to expansion of the stem. Leaves narrow,
long, three-nerved.</p>

<p>2. <i>Rhytidolepis</i>, Sternberg. Type, <i>S. scutellata</i>, Brongniart.&mdash;Ribs
narrow, and often transversely striate. Areoles large, hexagonal
or shield-shaped, tripunctate. Leaves as in last group. Kings
of rounded scars on the stems and branches mark attachment of
fruit. It is possible that some of the smaller stems of this group
may be branches of trees of group first.</p>

<p>3. <i>Syringodendron</i>, Sternberg. Type, <i>S. organum</i>, L. and H.,
<i>S. oculata</i>, Brongniart.&mdash;Stems ribbed; areoles small and round,
and apparently with a single scar, or three closely approximated.
These are rare, and liable to be confounded with decorticated examples
of other groups; but I have some specimens which unquestionably
represent the external surface.</p>

<p>4. <i>Favularia</i>, Sternberg. Type, <i>Sigillaria elegans</i> of Brongniart.&mdash;Leaf-bases
hexagonal, or in young branches elliptical, in vertical
rows, but without distinct ribs, except in old or decorticated stems.
Fruit borne in verticils on the branches bearing transverse rows of
rounded scars. Leaves somewhat broad and longitudinally striate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">« 159 »</a></span></p>

<p>5. <i>Leioderma</i>, Goldenberg. Type, <i>S. Sydnensis</i>, Dawson.&mdash;Ribs
obsolete. Cortical and ligneous surfaces striate. Vascular
scars double, elongate longitudinally, and alike on cortical and inner
surfaces. Areoles in rows and distinct; stigmaria-roots striate, with
small and distinct areoles.</p>

<p>6. <i>Clathraria</i>, Brongniart. Type, <i>S. Menardi</i>, Brongniart.&mdash;Areoles
hexagonal, not in distinct rows, but having a spiral appearance.
Some of the plants usually referred to this group are probably
branches of <i>Favularia</i>. Others are evidently fragments of plants
of the genus <i>Lepidophloios</i>.</p>


<p>3. <i>Internal Structures of Sigillaria-Stems</i>.</p>

<p>I long ago pointed out, on the evidence of the external markings
and mode of growth, that the stems of <i>Sigillariæ</i> must have been
exogenous, and this conclusion has now been fully confirmed by the
microscopic researches of Williamson, not only in the case of <i>Sigillariæ</i>,
but of <i>Lepidodendra</i> and <i>Calamodendra</i> as well. Confining
myself to my own observations, three types of <i>Sigillariæ</i> are known
to me by their internal structures, though I cannot certainly correlate
all of these with the external markings referred to above.</p>

<p>1. <i>Diploxylon</i>, in which the stem consists of a small internal
axis surrounded by a very thick inner bark and a dense outer cortex.
A fine example from the South Joggins is thus described:<a name="FNanchor_CU_99" id="FNanchor_CU_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_CU_99" class="fnanchor">[CU]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_CU_99" id="Footnote_CU_99"></a><a href="#FNanchor_CU_99"><span class="label">[CU]</span></a> &ldquo;Journal of the Geological Society of London,&rdquo; November, 1877.</p></div>

<p>"The axis of the stem is about six centimetres in its greatest
diameter, and consists of a central pith-cylinder and two concentric
coats of scalariform tissue. The pith-cylinder is replaced
by sandstone, and is about one centimetre in diameter. The inner
cylinder of scalariform tissue is perfectly continuous, not radiated,
and about one millimetre in thickness. Its vessels are somewhat
crushed, but have been of large diameter. Its outer surface, which
readily separates from that of the outer cylinder, is striated longitudinally.
The outer cylinder, which constitutes by much the
largest part of the whole, is also composed of scalariform tissue;
but this is radially arranged, with the individual cells quadrangular
in cross-section. The cross-bars are similar on all the sides and
usually simple and straight, but sometimes branching or slightly
reticulated. The wall intervening between the bars has extremely
delicate longitudinal waving lines of ligneous lining, in the manner
first described by Williamson as occurring in the scalariform tissue
of certain <i>Lepidodendra</i>. A few small radiating spaces, partially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">« 160 »</a></span>
occupied with pyrites, obscurely represent the medullary rays, which
must have been very feebly developed. The radiating bundles
passing to the leaves run nearly horizontally; but their structure
is very imperfectly preserved. The stem being old and probably
long deprived of its leaves, they may have been partially disorganised
before it was fossilised. The outer surface of the axis is striated
longitudinally, and in some places marked with impressions of tortuous
fibres, apparently those of the inner bark. In the cross-section,
where weathered, it shows concentric rings; but under the
microscope these appear rather as bands of compressed tissue than
as proper lines of growth. They are about twenty in number. This
tree has an erect, ribbed trunk, twelve feet in height and fifteen
inches in diameter, swelling to about two feet at the base."</p>

<p>2. <i>Favularia Type.</i>&mdash;This has been well described by Brongniart
and by Renault,<a name="FNanchor_CV_100" id="FNanchor_CV_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_CV_100" class="fnanchor">[CV]</a> and differs from the above chiefly in the fact that
the outer exogenous woody zone is composed of reticulated instead
of scalariform tissue, and the inner zone is of the peculiar form
which I have characterised as pseudo-scalariform.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_CV_100" id="Footnote_CV_100"></a><a href="#FNanchor_CV_100"><span class="label">[CV]</span></a> &ldquo;Botanique Fossile,&rdquo; Paris, 1881.</p></div>

<p>3. <i>Sigillaria Proper.</i>&mdash;This I have illustrated in my paper in
the &ldquo;Journal of the Geological Society&rdquo; for May, 1871, and it appears
to represent the highest and most perfect type of the larger
ribbed <i>Sigillaria</i>. This structure I have described as follows, basing
my description on a very fine axis found in an erect stem, and
on the fragments of the woody axis found in the bases of other erect
stems:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> A dense cellular outer bark, usually in the state of compact
coal&mdash;but when its structure is preserved, showing a tissue of thickened
parenchymatous cells.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> A very thick inner bark, which has usually in great part
perished, or been converted into coal, but which, in old trunks, contained
a large quantity of prosenchymatous tissue, very tough and
of great durability. This &ldquo;bast-tissue&rdquo; is comparable with that of
the inner bark of modern conifers, and constitutes much of the mineral
charcoal of the coal-seams.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> An outer ligneous cylinder, composed of wood-cells, either
with a single row of large bordered pores,<a name="FNanchor_CW_101" id="FNanchor_CW_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_CW_101" class="fnanchor">[CW]</a> in the manner of pines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">« 161 »</a></span>
and cycads, or with two, three, or four rows of such pores sometimes
inscribed in hexagonal areoles in the manner of Dadoxylon. This
woody cylinder is traversed by medullary rays, which are short, and
composed of few rows of cells superimposed. It is also traversed by
oblique radiating bundles of pseudo-scalariform tissue proceeding to
the leaves. In some <i>Sigillariæ</i> this outer cylinder was itself in part
composed of pseudo-scalariform tissue, as in Brongniart&rsquo;s specimen
of <i>S. elegans</i>; and in others its place may have been taken by multiporous
tissue, as in a case above referred to; but I have no reason
to believe that either of these variations occurred in the typical
ribbed species now in question. The woody fibres of the outer
cylinder may be distinguished most readily from those of conifers,
as already mentioned, by the thinness of their walls, and the more
irregular distribution of the pores. Additional characters are furnished
by the medullary rays and the radiating bundles of scalariform
tissue when these can be observed.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_CW_101" id="Footnote_CW_101"></a><a href="#FNanchor_CW_101"><span class="label">[CW]</span></a> These are the same with the wood-cells elsewhere called discigerous
tissue, and to which I have applied the terms uniporous and multiporous.
The markings on the walls are caused by an unlined portion of the cell-wall
placed in a disk or depression, and this often surrounded by an
hexagonal rim of thickened wall; but in all cases these structures are
less pronounced than in <i>Dadoxylon</i>, and less regular in the walls of the
same cell, as well as in different layers of the tissues of the axis.</p></div>

<p><i>d.</i> An inner cylinder of pseudo-scalariform tissue. I have
adopted the term pseudo-scalariform for this tissue, from the conviction
that it is not homologous with the scalariform ducts of ferns
and other acrogens, but that it is merely a modification of the discigerous
wood-cells, with pores elongated transversely, and sometimes
separated by thickened bars, corresponding to the hexagonal areolation
of the ordinary wood-cells. A similar tissue exists in cycads,
and is a substitute for the spiral vessels existing in ordinary exogens.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> A large medulla, or pith, consisting of a hollow cylinder of
cellular tissue, from which proceed numerous thin diaphragms towards
the centre of the stem.</p>

<p>These structures of the highest type of <i>Sigillaria</i> are on the
one hand scarcely advanced beyond those of Calamopitus, as described
by Williamson, and on the other approach to those of
<i>Cordaites</i>, as seen in specimens presented to me by Renault.</p>

<p>Finally, as to the fruit of <i>Sigillariæ</i>, I have no new facts to
offer. The strobiles or spikes associated with these trees have been
variously described as gymnospermous (Renault) or cryptogamous
(Groldenberg and Williamson). 1 have never seen them in place.
Two considerations, however, have always weighed with me in reference
to this subject. One is the constant abundance of Trigonocarpa
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">« 162 »</a></span>
and Cardiocarpa in the soil of the Sigiliaria forests, as I have studied
this at the South Joggins. The other is that the rings of fruit-scars
on the branches of Sigiliaria are homologous with leaf-scars, not
with branches, and therefore should have borne single carpels and
not cones or spikes of inflorescence. These are merely suggestions,
but I have no doubt they will be vindicated by future discoveries,
which will, I have no doubt, show that in the family <i>Sigillariaceæ</i>
we have really two families, one possibly of gymnospermous rank,
or at least approaching to this, the other allied to the Lepidodendra.</p>

<p class="caption4"><i>Family</i> <span class="smcap">Lepidodendreæ</span>; <i>Genus</i> <span class="smcap">Lepidodendron</span>, Sternberg.</p>

<p>These are arboreal Lycopods having linear one-nerved leaves,
stems branching dichotomously, and with ovate or rhombic leaf-bases
bearing rhombic leaf-scars, often very prominent. The fruit is in
scaly strobiles, terminal or lateral, and there are usually, if not
always, macrospores and microspores in each strobile. The young
branches and stems have a central pith, a cylinder of scalariform
tubes sending out ascending bundles to the leaves through a thick
cellular and fibrous inner bark, and externally a dense cortex confluent
with or consisting of the leaf-bases. Older stems have a second or
outer layer of scalariform fibres in wedges with medullary rays, and
strengthening the stem by a true exogenous growth, much as in the
Diploxylon type of Sigiliaria. The development of this exogenous
cylinder is different in amount and rate in different species.<a name="FNanchor_CX_102" id="FNanchor_CX_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_CX_102" class="fnanchor">[CX]</a> This
different development of the exogenous axis is accompanied with
appropriate external appearances in the stems, and the changes
which take place in their markings. These are of three kinds. In
some species the areoles, at first close together, become, in the process
of the expansion of the stem, separated by intervening spaces of
bark in a perfectly regular manner; so that in old stems, while widely
separated, they still retain their arrangement, while in young stems
they are quite close to one another. This is the case in <i>L. corrugatum</i>.
In other species the leaf-scars or bases increase in size in the
old stems, still retaining their forms and their contiguity to each
other. This is the case in <i>L. undulatum</i>, and generally in those
<i>Lepidodendra</i> which have large leaf-bases. In these species the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">« 163 »</a></span>
continued vitality of the bark is shown by the occasional production
of lateral strobiles on large branches, in the manner of the modern
red pine of America. In other species the areoles neither increase in
size nor become regularly separated by growth of the intervening
bark; but in old stems the bark splits into deep furrows, between
which may be seen portions of bark still retaining the areoles in
their original dimensions and arrangement. This is the case with
<i>L. Pictoense</i>. This cracking of the bark no doubt occurs in very old
trunks of the first two types, but not at all to the same extent.</p>

<p>As a type of Lepidodendron, I may describe one of the oldest
Carboniferous species characteristic of the Lower Carboniferous in
America, and corresponding to <i>L. Veltheimianum</i> of Europe.</p>

<p><i>Habit of Growth.</i>&mdash;Somewhat slender, with long branches and
long, slender leaves having a tendency to become horizontal or
drooping.</p>

<p><i>Markings of Stem.</i>&mdash;Leaf-bases disposed in quincunx or spirally,
elongate, ovate, acute at both ends, but more acute and slightly
oblique at the lower end; most prominent in the upper third, and
with a slight vertical ridge. Leaf-scars small, rounded, and showing
only a single punctiform vascular scar. The leaf-scar on the outer
surface is in the upper third of the base; but the obliquity of the
vascular bundle causes it to be nearly central on the inside of the
epidermis. In young succulent shoots the leaf-scars are contiguous
and round as in Cyclostigma, without distinct leaf-bases. In this
state it closely resembles <i>L. Olivieri</i>, Eichwald.<a name="FNanchor_CY_103" id="FNanchor_CY_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_CY_103" class="fnanchor">[CY]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_CY_103" id="Footnote_CY_103"></a><a href="#FNanchor_CY_103"><span class="label">[CY]</span></a> Lethæa Rossica, Plate Y, Figs. 12, 13.</p></div>

<p>In the ordinary young branches the leaf-scars are contiguous,
and closely resemble those of <i>L. elegans</i>, Brongt. (<a href="#fig43">Fig. 43 C</a>). As the
branches increase in diameter the leaf-scars slightly enlarge and
sometimes assume a verticillate appearance (<a href="#fig43">Fig. 43 D</a>). As they
still further enlarge they become separated by gradually increasing
spaces of bark, marked with many waving striæ or wrinkles
(<a href="#fig43">Fig. 43 I, N</a>). At the base of old stems the bark assumes a generally
wrinkled appearance without distinct scars.</p>

<p><i>Knorria or Decorticated States.</i>&mdash;Of these there is a great variety,
depending on the state of preservation, and the particular longitudinal
ridges. <a href="#fig43">Fig. 43 D</a> shows a form in which the vascular bundles
appear as cylindrical truncate projections. Other forms show
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">« 164 »</a></span>
the leaf-bases prominent, or have an appearance of longitudinal ribbing
produced by the expansion of the bark.</p>

<p><i>Structure of Stem.</i>&mdash;This is not perfectly preserved in any of
my specimens, but one flattened specimen shows a central medulla
with a narrow ring of scalariform vessels surrounding it, and constituting
the woody axis. The structure is thus similar to that of <i>L.
Harcourtii</i>, which I regard as probably the same with the closely
allied European species L. Veltheimianum.</p>

<p><i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;These are narrow, one-nerved, curving somewhat rapidly
outward (<a href="#fig43">Figs. 43, B, C, D</a>). They vary from one to two inches
in length.</p>

<p><i>Roots.</i>&mdash;I have not seen these actually attached, but they occur
very abundantly in the under-clays of some erect forests of these
plants at Horton Bluff, and are of the character of Stigmariæ (Figs. <a href="#fig30">30</a>, <a href="#fig31">31</a>).
In some of the under-clays the long, flattened rootlets are excessively
abundant, and show the mark of a central vascular bundle.</p>

<p><i>Fructification.</i>&mdash;Cones terminal, short, with many small, acute
imbricate scales. Spore-cases globular, smooth (<a href="#fig43">Fig. 43 C</a>). On
the surface of some shales and sandstones at Horton there are innumerable
round spore-cases of this tree about the size of mustard-seed
(<a href="#fig43">Fig. 43 F</a>). Large slabs are sometimes covered with these, and thin
layers of shale are filled with flattened specimens.</p>

<p>This is the characteristic species of the Lower Carboniferous coal-measures,
occurring in great profusion at Horton Bluff and its
vicinity, also at Sneid&rsquo;s Mills near Windsor, Noel and Five-Mile
River, at Norton Creek and elsewhere in New Brunswick (Matthew&rsquo;s
collection), and at Antigonish (Honeyman&rsquo;s collection).</p>

<p>I have received from the lowest Carboniferous beds of Ohio specimens
of this species.<a name="FNanchor_CZ_104" id="FNanchor_CZ_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_CZ_104" class="fnanchor">[CZ]</a> According to Rogers and Lesquereux similar
forms occur in the Vespertine of Pennsylvania and in the Lower
Carboniferous of Illinois. <i>L. Veltheimianum</i> of western Europe
and <i>L. glincanum</i> of Russia are closely allied Lower Carboniferous
species.<a name="FNanchor_DA_105" id="FNanchor_DA_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_DA_105" class="fnanchor">[DA]</a></p>

<p>A very different type is furnished by a new species from the
middle coal-formation of Clifton, New Brunswick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lepidodendron Cliftonense</span>, Dawson.&mdash;<i>Habit of Growth</i>.&mdash;Robust,
with thick branches, and leaves several inches in length.
Terminal branches becoming slender, with shorter leaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">« 165 »</a></span></p>

<p><i>Markings of Stem.</i>&mdash;Leaf-bases long oval, pointed at ends, enlarging
with growth of stem. Leaf-scars central, rhombic, transverse.</p>

<p><i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;One-nerved, acutely pointed, from four inches in length
on the larger branches to one inch or less on the branchlets.</p>

<p><i>Fructification.</i>&mdash;Cones large, cylindrical or long oval, with large
scales of trigonal form, and not elongated but lying close to the surface.
Borne on lateral, slender branchlets, with short leaves.</p>

<p class="caption4"><i>Genus</i> <span class="smcap">Lepidophloios</span>, Sternberg; <span class="smcap">Ulodendron</span>, L. and H.;
<span class="smcap">Lomatophloios</span>, Corda.</p>

<p><i>Lepidophloios.</i>&mdash;Under this generic name, established by Sternberg,
I include those lycopodiaceous trees of the coal-measures
which have thick branches, transversely elongated leaf-scars, each
with three vascular points and placed on elevated or scale-like protuberances,
long one-nerved leaves, and large lateral strobiles in vertical
rows or spirally disposed. Their structure resembles that of
<i>Lepidodendron</i>, consisting of a <i>Sternbergia</i> pith, a slender axis of
large scalariform vessels, giving off from its surface bundles of
smaller vessels to the leaves, a very thick cellular bark, and a thin
dense outer bark, having some elongated cells or bast-tissue on its
inner side. In these trees the exogenous outer cylinder is less developed
than in the Lepidodendra, and is sometimes wanting in
stems or branches of some thickness.</p>

<p>Regarding <i>L. laricinum</i> of Sternberg as the type of the genus,
and taking in connection with this the species described by Goldenberg,
and my own observations on numerous specimens found in
Nova Scotia, 1 have no doubt that <i>Lomatophloios crassicaulis</i> of
Corda, and other species of that genus described by Goldenberg,
<i>Ulodendron</i> and <i>Bothrodendron</i> of Lindley, <i>Lepidodendron ornatissimum</i>
of Brongniart, and <i>Halonia punctata</i> of Geinitz, all belong
to this genus, and differ from each other only in conditions of
growth and preservation. Several of the species of <i>Lepidostrobus</i>
and <i>Lepidophyllum</i> also belong to <i>Lepidophloios</i>.</p>

<p>The species of <i>Lepidophloios</i> are readily distinguished from
<i>Lepidodendron</i> by the form of the areoles, and by the round scars on
the stem, which usually mark the insertion of the large strobiles,
though in barren stems they may also have produced branches; still,
the fact of my finding the strobiles <i>in situ</i> in one instance, the accurate
resemblance which the scars bear to those left by the cones of
the red pine when borne on thick branches, and the actual impressions
of the radiating scales in some specimens, leave no doubt in my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">« 166 »</a></span>
mind that they are usually the marks of cones; and the great size of
the cones of <i>Lepidophloios</i> accords with this conclusion.</p>

<p>The species of <i>Lepidophloios</i> are numerous, and individuals are
quite abundant in the coal formation, especially toward its upper
part. Their flattened bark is frequent in the coal-beds and their
roofs, affording a thin layer of pure coal, which sometimes shows the
peculiar laminated or scaly character of the bark when other characters
are almost entirely obliterated. The leaves also are nearly as
abundant as those of Sigillaria in the coal-shales. They can readily
be distinguished by their strong, angular midrib.</p>

<p>The markings of <i>Lepidophloios</i> may easily be mistaken for those
of the <i>Clathraria</i> type of <i>Sigillaria</i>. When the stem only is seen,
they can be distinguished by the length of the leaf-bases in <i>Lepidophloios</i>,
and by the dominant central vascular scar; also by the
one-nerved and ribbed leaves. Where the large, round marks of the
cones are present, these are an infallible guide, never being present
in <i>Sigillaria</i>. As the cones grew on the upper sides of the branches,
the impression of the lower side often shows no cone-scars, or only
two lateral rows, whereas on the upper side of the same branch they
appear spirally arranged. I may describe as an example&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lepidophloios Acadianus</i>, Dawson. Leaf-bases broadly rhombic,
or in old stems regularly rhombic, prominent, ascending, terminated
by very broad rhombic scars having a central point and two
lateral obscure points. Outer bark laminated or scaly. Surface of
inner bark with single points or depressions. Leaves long, linear,
with a strong keel on one side, five inches or more in length. Cone-scars
sparsely scattered on thick branches, either in two rows or
spirally, both modes being sometimes seen on the same branch.
Scalariform axis scarcely an inch in diameter in a stem five inches
thick. Fruit, an ovate strobile with numerous acute scales covering
small globular spore-cases. This species is closely allied to <i>Ulodendron
majus</i> and <i>Lepidophloios laricinus</i>, and presents numerous
varieties of marking. Coal-formation, Nova Scotia.</p>

<p class="caption4"><i>Family</i> <span class="smcap">Calamiteæ</span>; <i>Genus</i> <span class="smcap">Calamites</span>, Suckow.</p>

<p>The plants of this genus are unquestionably allied to the modern
<i>Equisetaceæ</i>, but excel these so much in variety of form and
structure, and are so capricious in their states of preservation, and so
liable to be mistaken for parts of plants generically different, that
they have given rise to much controversy. The following considerations
will enable us to arrive at some certainty.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Calamites</i> was originally founded in the longitudinally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">« 167 »</a></span>
ribbed and jointed stems so frequent in the coal-formation,
and of which the common <i>C. Suckovii</i> is a typical form. The most
perfect of these stems represent the outer surface immediately within
the epidermis, in which case transverse lines or constrictions
mark the nodes, and at the nodes there are rounded spots, sometimes
indicating radial processes of the pith, first described by
Williamson; in other cases, the attachment of branchlets, or in some
specimens both. But some specimens show the outer surface of the
epidermis, in which case the transverse nodal lines are usually invisible,
though the scars of branchlets may appear. In still other
examples the whole of the outer tissues have perished, and the so-called
Calamite is a cast of the interior of the stem, showing merely
longitudinal ribbing and transverse nodal constrictions. In studying
these plants <i>in situ</i> in the erect Calamite brakes of the coal-formation
of Nova Scotia, one soon becomes familiar with these appearances,
but they are evidently unknown to the majority of palæobotanists,
though described in detail more than twenty years ago.</p>

<p>When the outer surface is preserved it is sometimes seen to bear
verticils of long needle-like leaves (<i>C. Cistii</i>), or of branchlets with
secondary whorls of similar leaves (<i>C. Suckovii</i> and <i>C. undulatus</i>).
No Calamite known to me bears broad one-nerved leaves like those
of <i>Asterophyllites</i> and <i>Annularia</i>, though the larger stems of these
plants have been described as Calamites, and the term <i>Calamocladus</i>
has been used to include both groups. The base of the Calamite
stem usually terminates in a blunt point, and may be attached to a
rhizome, or several stems may bud out from each other in a group or
stool. The roots are long and cylindrical, sometimes branching.
The fruit consists of spikes of spore-cases, borne in whorls and subtended
by linear floral leaves. To these strobiles the name Calamostachys
has been given.</p>

<p>Williamson has shown that the stem of Calamites consists of a
central pith or cavity of large size surrounded by a cylinder consisting
of alternate wedges of woody and cellular matter, with vertical
canals at the inner sides of the wedges, and slender medullary
rays. The thick cellular wedges intervening between the woody
wedges he calls primary medullary rays; the smaller medullary
rays in the wedges, secondary medullary rays. There is thus a
highly complex exogenous stem based on the same principle with
the stem of a common <i>Equisetum</i>, but with much greater strength
and complexity.</p>

<p>Williamson has also shown that there are different sub-types of
these stems. More especially he refers to the three following:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">« 168 »</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Calamites</i> proper, which has the woody wedges of scalariform
or barred tissue with thin medullary rays, and the thick primary
medullary rays are cellular.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Calamopitus</i> has reticulated or multiporous tissue in the
woody wedges with medullary rays, and the primary medullary
wedges are composed of elongated cells.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Calamodendron</i> has the woody wedges of barred tissue as in
<i>a</i>, with medullary rays, but has the intervening medullary wedges
of an elongated tissue approaching to woody fibre, and also with
medullary rays.</p>

<p>To these I would add a fourth type, which I have described, from
the coal-formation of Nova Scotia.<a name="FNanchor_DB_106" id="FNanchor_DB_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_DB_106" class="fnanchor">[DB]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_DB_106" id="Footnote_DB_106"></a><a href="#FNanchor_DB_106"><span class="label">[DB]</span></a> &ldquo;Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society,&rdquo; 1871.</p></div>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Eucalamodendron</i> differs from <i>Calamodendron</i> in having
true bordered pores or pseudo-scalariform slit-pored tissue, and corresponds
to the highest type of calamitean stem.</p>

<p>I would also add that under <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> there are some species in
which the woody cylinder is very thin in comparison to the size of
the stem. In <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> the woody cylinder is thick and massive, and
the stems are often large and nodose.</p>

<p>As an example of an ordinary Calamite in which the external
surface and foliage are preserved, I may quote the following from
my report on the &ldquo;Flora of the Lower Carboniferous and Millstone
Grit,&rdquo; 1873:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Calamites Undulatus</span>, Brongniart.&mdash;This species is stated by
Brongniart to be distinguished from the <i>C. Suckovii</i>, the characteristic
Calamite of the middle coal-formation, by its undulated ribs
marked with peculiar cellular reticulation. He suggests that it may
be merely a variety of <i>C. Suckovii</i>, an opinion in which Schimper
coincides; but since I have received large additional collections from
Mr. Elder, containing not only the stems and branches, but also the
leaves and rhizomes, I am constrained to regard it as a distinct
though closely allied species.</p>

<p>The rhizomata are slender, being from one to two inches in
diameter, and perfectly flattened. They are beautifully covered with
a cellular reticulation on the thin bark, and show occasional round
areoles marking the points of exit of the rootlets. I have long been
familiar with irregular flattened stems thus reticulate, but have only
recently been able to connect them with this species of Calamite.</p>

<p>The main stems present a very thin carbonaceous bark reticulated
like the rhizomes. They have flat, broad ribs separated by deep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">« 169 »</a></span>
and narrow furrows, and undulated in a remarkable manner even
when the stems are flattened. This undulation is, however, perhaps an
indication of vertical pressure while the plant was living, as it seems
to have had an unusually thin and feeble cortical layer, and the undulations
are apparently best developed in the lower part of the stem.
At the nodes the ribs are often narrowed and gathered together,
especially in the vicinity of the rounded radiating marks which appear
to indicate the points of insertion of the branches. At the top
of each rib we have the usual rounded areole, probably marking the
insertion of a primary branchlet.</p>

<p>The branches have slender ribs and distant nodes, from which
spring secondary branchlet s in whorls, these bearing in turn small
whorls of acicular leaflets much curved upward, and which are apparently
round in cross section and delicately striate. They are
much shorter than the leaves of <i>Calamites Suckovii</i>, and are less
dense and less curved than those of <i>C. nodosus</i>, which I believe to be
the two most closely allied species.</p>

<p>Lesquereux notices this species as characteristic of the lower part
of the Carboniferous in Arkansas.</p>

<p>It will be observed that I regard the striated and ribbed stems not
as internal axes, but as representing the outer surface of the plants.
This was certainly the case with the present species and with <i>C.
Suckovii</i> and <i>C. nodosus</i>. Other species, and especially those which
belonged to Calamodendron, no doubt had a smooth or irregularly
wrinkled external bark; but this gives no good ground for the manner
in which some writers on this subject confound Calamites with
Calamodendra, and both with Asterophyllites and Sphenophyllum.
With this no one who has studied these plants, rooted in their native
soils, and with their appendages still attached, can for a moment
sympathise. One of the earliest geological studies of the writer was
a bed of these erect Calamites, which he showed to Sir C. Lyell in
1844, and described in the &ldquo;Proceedings of the Geological Society&rdquo;
in 1851, illustrating the habit of growth as actually seen well exposed
in a sandstone cliff. Abundant opportunities of verifying
the conclusions formed at that time have since occurred, the results
of which have been summed up in the figures in Acadian Geology,
which, though they have been treated by some botanists as merely
restorations, are in reality representations of facts actually observed.</p>

<p>On these subjects, without entering into details, and referring
for these to the elaborate discussions of Schimper, Williamson, and
McNab, and to my paper on the subject, &ldquo;Journal of the Geological
Society,&rdquo; vol. xxvii, p. 54, I may remark:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">« 170 »</a></span></p>

<p>1. That the aërial stems of ordinary Calamites had a thin cortical
layer, with lacunæ and fibrous bundles and multiporous vessels&mdash;the
whole not differing much from the structure of modern Equiseta.</p>

<p>2. Certain arborescent forms, perhaps allied to the true Calamites,
as well as possibly the old underground stems of ordinary species<a name="FNanchor_DC_107" id="FNanchor_DC_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_DC_107" class="fnanchor">[DC]</a>
assumed a thick-walled character in which the tissues resembled the
wedges of an exogen, and abundance of pseudo-scalariform fibres were
developed, while the ribbing of the external surface became obsolete
or was replaced by a mere irregular wrinkling.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_DC_107" id="Footnote_DC_107"></a><a href="#FNanchor_DC_107"><span class="label">[DC]</span></a> Williamson, &ldquo;Transactions of the Royal Society.&rdquo; McNab, in
&ldquo;Proceedings of the Edinburgh Botanical Society.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>3. Sufficient discrimination has not been exercised in separating
casts of the internal cavities of Calamites and Calamodendron from
those representing other surfaces and the proper external surface.</p>

<p>4. There is no excuse for attributing to Calamites the foliage of
Annularia, Asterophyllites, and Sphenophyllum, since these leaves
have not been found attached to true Calamite stems, and since the
structure of the stems of Asterophyllites as described by Williamson,
and that of Sphenophyllum as described by the writer,<a name="FNanchor_DD_108" id="FNanchor_DD_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_DD_108" class="fnanchor">[DD]</a> are essentially
different from those of Calamites.</p>

<p>5. As the species above described indicates, good external characters
can be found for establishing species of this genus, and these
species are of value as marks of geological age.</p>

<p class="caption4"><i>Genus</i> <span class="smcap">Archæocalamites</span>, Sternberg.</p>

<p>This genus has been established to include certain Calamites of
the Devonian and Lower Carboniferous, in which the furrows on the
stem do not alternate at the nodes or joints, and the leaves in one
species at least bifurcate. <i>C. radiatus</i>, Brongniart, is the typical
species. In North America it occurs in the Erian, probably as low
as the Middle Erian. In Europe it has so far been recognised in the
Lower Carboniferous only. I have, however, seen stems from alleged
Devonian beds in Devonshire which may have belonged to this species.</p>

<p class="caption4"><i>Family</i> <span class="smcap">Asterophylliteæ</span>; <i>Genus</i> <span class="smcap">Asterophyllites</span>, Brongniart.</p>

<p>Stems ribbed and jointed like the <i>Calamites</i>, but with inflated
nodes and a stout internal woody cylinder, which has been described
by Williamson. From the joints proceeded whorls of leaves or of
branchlets, bearing leaves which differed from those of <i>Calamites</i> in
their having a distinct middle rib or vein. The fructification consisted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">« 171 »</a></span>
of long slender cones or spikes, having whorls of scales bearing
the spore-cases. Some authors speak of <i>Asterophyllites</i> as only
branches and leaves of <i>Calamites</i>; but though at first sight the resemblance
is great, a close inspection shows that the leaves of Asterophyllites
have a true midrib, which is wanting in <i>Calamites</i>.</p>

<p><i>Genus</i> <span class="smcap">Annularia</span>.&mdash;It is perhaps questionable whether these
plants should be separated from <i>Asterophyllites</i>, The distinction is
that they produce branches in pairs, and that their whorls of leaves
are one-sided and usually broader than those of <i>Asterophyllites</i>, and
united into a ring at their insertion on the stem. One little species,
<i>A. sphenophylloides</i>, is very widely distributed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pinnularia</span>&mdash;a provisional genus&mdash;-includes slender roots or stems
branching in a pinnate manner, and somewhat irregularly. They
are very abundant in the coal shales, and were probably not independent
plants, but aquatic roots belonging to some of the plants
last mentioned. The probability of this is farther increased by their
resemblance in miniature to the roots of <i>Calamites</i>. They are always
flattened, but seem originally to have been round, with a slender
thread-like axis of scalariform vessels, enclosed in a soft, smooth,
cellular bark.</p>

<p class="caption4"><i>Family</i> <span class="smcap">Rhizocarpeæ</span>; <i>Genus</i> <span class="smcap">Sphenophyllum</span>.</p>

<p>Leaves in whorls, wedge-shaped, with forking veins. Fructification
on spikes, with verticils of sporocarps. These plants are
by some regarded as allied to the <i>Calamiteæ</i> and <i>Asterophylliteæ</i>, by
others as a high grade of Rhizocarps of the type of Marsilia. The
stem had a star-shaped central bundle of scalariform or reticulato-scalariform
vessels.</p>

<p class="caption4"><i>Genus</i> <span class="smcap">Sporangites</span>. (<i>Sporocarpon</i>, Williamson.)</p>

<p>Under this name we may provisionally include those rounded
spherical bodies found in the coal and its accompanying beds, and
also in the Erian, which may be regarded as Macrospores or Sporocarps
of Protosalvinia, or other Rhizocarpean plants akin to those described
above in <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III</a>, which see for description.</p>

<p><i>Genus</i> <span class="smcap">Protosalvinia</span>.&mdash;Under this we include sporocarps allied

<p>Under this head I shall merely refer to a few groups of special
interest, and to the provisional arrangement adopted for the fronds
of ferns when destitute of fructification.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">« 172 »</a></span></p>

<p>The external appearances of trunks of tree-ferns have been already
referred to.</p>

<p>With respect to tree ferns, the oldest known examples are those
from the Middle Devonian of New York and Ohio, which I have described
in the &ldquo;Journal of the Geological Society,&rdquo; 1871 and 1881.
As these are of some interest, I have reproduced their descriptions
in a <a href="#NOTES_TO_CHAPTER_III">note</a> appended to Chapter III, which see.</p>

<p>The other forms most frequently occurring in the Carboniferous
are <i>Caulopteris</i>, <i>Palæopteris</i>, and <i>Megaphyton</i><a name="FNanchor_DE_109" id="FNanchor_DE_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_DE_109" class="fnanchor">[DE]</a> Stems showing
merely masses of aërial roots are known by the name <i>Psaronius</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_DE_109" id="Footnote_DE_109"></a><a href="#FNanchor_DE_109"><span class="label">[DE]</span></a> See my &ldquo;Acadian Geology,&rdquo; also below.</p></div>

<p>With reference to the classification of Palæozoic ferns, this has
hitherto been quite arbitrary, being based on mere form and venation
of fronds, but much advance has recently been made in the
knowledge of their fructification, warranting a more definite attempt
at classification. The following are provisional genera usually
adopted:</p>

<p>1. <i>Cyclopteris</i>, Brongniart.&mdash;Leaflets more or less rounded or
wedge-shaped, without midrib, the nerves spreading from the point
of attachment. This group includes a great variety of fronds evidently
of different genera, were their fructification known; and some
of them probably portions of fronds, the other parts of which may
be in the next genus.</p>

<p>2. <i>Neuropteris</i>, Brongniart.&mdash;Fronds pinnate, and with the
leaflets narrowed at the base; midrib often not distinct, and disappearing
toward the apex. Nervures equal, and rising at an acute
angle. Ferns of this type are among the most abundant in the coal-formation.</p>

<p>3. <i>Odontopteris</i>, Brongniart.&mdash;In these the frond is pinnate, and
the leaflets are attached by their whole base, with the nerves either
proceeding wholly from the base, or in part from an indistinct midrib,
which soon divides into nervures.</p>

<p>4. <i>Dictyopteris</i>, Gutbier.&mdash;This is a beautiful style of fern, with
leaflets resembling those of <i>Neuropteris</i>, but the veins arranged in a
network of oval spaces. Only a few species are known in the coal-formation.</p>

<p>5. <i>Lonchopteris</i>, Brongniart.&mdash;Ferns with netted veins like the
above, but with a distinct midrib, and the leaflets attached by the
whole base. Of this, also, we can boast but few species.</p>

<p>6. <i>Sphenopteris</i>, Brongniart.&mdash;These are elegant ferns, very numerous
in species, and most difficult to discriminate. Their most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">« 173 »</a></span>
distinctive characters are leaflets narrowed at the base, often lobed,
and with nervures dividing in a pinnate manner from the base.</p>

<p>7. <i>Phyllopteris</i>, Brongniart.&mdash;These are pinnate, with long lanceolate
pinnules, having a strong and well-defined midrib, and
nerves proceeding from it very obliquely, and dividing as they proceed
toward the margin. The ferns of this genus are for the most
part found in formations more recent than the Carboniferous; but I
have referred to it, with some doubt, one of our species.</p>

<p>8. <i>Alethopteris</i>, Brongniart.&mdash;This genus includes many of the
most common coal-formation ferns, especially the ubiquitous <i>A. lonchitica</i>,
which seems to have been the common brake of the coal-formation,
corresponding to <i>Pteris aquilina</i> in modern Europe and
America. These are brake-like ferns, pinnate, with leaflets often
long and narrow, decurrent on the petiole, adherent by their whole
base, and united at base to each other. The midrib is continuous to
the point, and the nervures run off from it nearly at right angles.
In some of these ferns the fructification is known to have been marginal,
as in <i>Pteris</i>.</p>

<p>9. <i>Pecopteris</i>, Brongniart.&mdash;This genus is intermediate between
the last and <i>Neuropteris</i>. The leaflets are attached by the whole
base, but not usually attached to each other; the midrib, though
slender, attains to the summit; the nervures are given off less obliquely
than in <i>Neuropteris</i>. This genus includes a large number of
our most common fossil ferns.</p>

<p>10. <i>Beinertia</i>, Goeppert.&mdash;A genus established by Goeppert for a
curious Pecopteris-like fern, with flexuous branching oblique nervures
becoming parallel to the edge of the frond.</p>

<p>11. <i>Hymenophyllites</i>, Goeppert.&mdash;These are ferns similar to
Sphenopteris, but divided at the margin into one-nerved lobes, in the
manner of the modern genus <i>Hymenophyllum</i>.</p>

<p>12. <i>Palæopteris</i>, Geinitz.&mdash;This is a genus formed to include certain
trunks of tree-ferns with oval transverse scars of leaves.</p>

<p>13. <i>Caulopteris</i>, Lindley and Hutton.&mdash;Is another genus of fossil
trunks of tree-ferns, but with elongate scars of leaves.</p>

<p>14. <i>Psaronius</i>, Cotta.&mdash;Includes other trunks of tree-ferns with
alternate scars or thick scales, and ordinarily with many aërial roots
grouped round them, as in some modern tree-ferns.</p>

<p>15. <i>Megaphyton</i>, Artis.&mdash;Includes trunks of tree-ferns which
bore their fronds, which were of great size, in two rows, one on each
side of the stem. These were very peculiar trees, less like modern
ferns than any of the others. My reasons for regarding them as
ferns are stated in the following extract from a recent paper:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">« 174 »</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Their thick stems, marked with linear scars and having two
rows of large depressed areoles on the sides, suggest no affinities to
any known plants. They are usually ranked with <i>Lepidodendron</i>
and <i>Ulodendron</i>, but sometimes, and probably with greater reason,
are regarded as allied to tree-ferns. At the Joggins a very fine
species (<i>M. magnificum</i>) has been found, and at Sydney a smaller
species (<i>M. humile</i>); but both are rare and not well preserved. If
the large scars bore cones and the smaller bore leaves, then, as Brongniart
remarks, the plant would much resemble <i>Lepidophloios</i>, in
which the cone-scars are thus sometimes distichous. But the scars
are not round and marked with radiating scales as in <i>Lepidophloios</i>;
they are reniform or oval, and resemble those of tree-ferns, for which
reason they may be regarded as more probably leaf-scars; and in
that case the smaller linear scars would indicate ramenta, or small
aërial roots. Further, the plant described by Corda as <i>Zippea disticha</i>
is evidently a <i>Megaphyton</i>, and the structure of that species is
plainly that of a tree-fern of somewhat peculiar type. On these
grounds I incline to the opinion of Geinitz that these curious trees
were allied to ferns, and bore two rows of large fronds, the trunks
being covered with coarse hairs or small aërial roots. At one time I
was disposed to suspect that they may have crept along the ground;
but a specimen from Sydney shows the leaf-stalks proceeding from
the stem at an angle so acute that the stem must, I think, have been
erect. From the appearance of the scars it is probable that only a
pair of fronds were borne at one time at the top of the stem; and, if
these were broad and spreading, it would be a very graceful plant.
To what extent plants of this type contributed to the accumulation
of coal I have no means of ascertaining, their tissues in the state of
coal not being distinguishable from those of ferns and <i>Lycopodiaceæ</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption3">THE FLORA OF THE EARLY MESOZOIC.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Great</span> physical changes occurred at the close of the
Carboniferous age. The thick beds of sediment that had
been accumulating in long lines along the primitive continents
had weighed down the earth&rsquo;s crust. Slow subsidence
had been proceeding from this cause in the coal-formation
period, and at its close vast wrinklings occurred,
only surpassed by those of the old Laurentian time.
Hence in the Appalachian region of America we have the
Carboniferous beds thrown into abrupt folds, their shales
converted into hard slates, their sandstones into quartzite
and their coals into anthracite, and all this before the
deposition of the Triassic Red Sandstones which constitute
the earliest deposit of the great succeeding Mesozoic
period. In like manner the coal-fields of Wales and
elsewhere in western Europe have suffered similar treatment,
and apparently at the same time.</p>

<p>This folding is, however, on both sides of the Atlantic
limited to a band on the margin of the continents, and to
certain interior lines of pressure, while in the middle, as
in Ohio and Illinois in America, and in the great interior
plains of Europe, the coal-beds are undisturbed and unaltered.
In connection with this we have an entire
change in the physical character of the deposits, a great
elevation of the borders of the continents, and probably
a considerable deepening of the seas, leading to the establishment
of general geographical conditions which still
remain, though they have been temporarily modified by
subsequent subsidences and re-elevations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">« 176 »</a></span></p>

<p>Along with this a great change was in progress in
vegetable and animal life. The flora and fauna of the
Palæozoic gradually die out in the Permian and are replaced
in the succeeding Trias by those of the Mesozoic
time. Throughout the Permian, however, the remains
of the coal-formation flora continue to exist, and some
forms, as the <i>Calamites</i>, even seem to gain in importance,
as do also certain types of coniferous trees. The Triassic,
as well as the Permian, was marked by physical disturbances,
more especially by great volcanic eruptions discharging
vast beds and dykes of lava and layers of volcanic
ash and agglomerate. This was the case more especially
along the margins of the Atlantic, and probably also on
those of the Pacific. The volcanic sheets and dykes associated
with the Red Sandstones of Nova Scotia, Connecticut,
and New Jersey are evidences of this.</p>

<p>At the close of the Permian and beginning of the
Trias, in the midst of this transition time of physical
disturbance, appear the great reptilian forms characteristic
of the age of reptiles, and the earliest precursors of
the mammals, and at this time the old Carboniferous
forms of plants finally pass away, to be replaced by a
flora scarcely more advanced, though different, and consisting
of pines, cycads, and ferns, with gigantic equiseta,
which are the successors of the genus <i>Calamites</i>, a genus
which still survives in the early Trias. Of these groups
the conifers, the ferns, and the equiseta are already familiar
to us, and, in so far as they are concerned, a botanist
who had studied the flora of the Carboniferous would
have found himself at home in the succeeding period.
The cycads are a new introduction. The whole, however,
come within the limits of the cryptogams and the
gymnosperms, so that here we have no advance.<a name="FNanchor_DF_110" id="FNanchor_DF_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_DF_110" class="fnanchor">[DF]</a></p>

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 64.&mdash;Jurassic vegetation. Cycads and pines. (After Saporta.)</div>
</div>

<p>As we ascend, however, in the Mesozoic, we find new
and higher types. Even within the Jurassic epoch, the
next in succession to the Trias, there are clear indications
of the presence of the endogens, in species allied to
the screw-pines and grasses; and the palms appear a
little later, while a few exogenous trees have left their
remains in the Lower Cretaceous, and in the Middle and
Upper Cretaceous these higher plants come in abundantly
and in generic forms still extant, so that the dawn
of the modern flora belongs to the Middle and Upper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">« 178 »</a></span>
Cretaceous. It will thus be convenient to confine ourselves
in this chapter to the flora of the earlier Mesozoic.</p>

<p>Passing over for the present the cryptogamous plants
already familiar in older deposits, we may notice the new
features of gymnospermous and phænogamous life, as they
present themselves in this earlier part of the great reptilian
age, and as they extended themselves with remarkable
uniformity in this period over all parts of the world.
For it is a remarkable fact that, if we place together in
our collections fossil plants of this period from Australia,
India, China, Siberia, Europe, or even from Greenland,
we find wonderfully little difference in their aspect. This
uniformity we have already seen prevailed in the Palæozoic
flora; and it is perhaps equally marked in that of
the Mesozoic. Still we must bear in mind that some
of the plants of these periods, as the ferns and pines,
for example, are still
world-wide in their
distribution; but this
does not apply to others,
more especially
the cycads (<a href="#fig65">Fig. 65</a>).</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 274px;">

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 65.&mdash;<i>Podozamites lanceolatus</i>, Sternb.
L. Cretaceous.</div>
</div>

<p>The cycads constitute
a singular and exceptional
type in the
modern world, and
are limited at present
to the warmer climates,
though very
generally distributed
in these, as they occur
in Africa, India,
Japan, Australia, Mexico, Florida, and the West Indies.
In the Mesozoic age, however, they were world-wide in
their distribution, and are found as far north as Greenland,
though most of the species found in the Cretaceous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">« 179 »</a></span>
of that country are of small size/ and may have been of
low growth, so that they may have been protected by the
snows of winter. The cycads have usually simple or unbranching
stems, pinnate leaves borne in a crown at top,
and fruits which, though somewhat various in structure
and arrangement, are all of the simpler form of gymnospermous
type. The stems are exogenous in structure,
but with slender wood and thick bark, and barred tissue,
or properly as tissue intermediate between this and the
disc-bearing fibres of the pines.</p>

<p>Though the cycads have a considerable range of organisation
and of fructification, and though some points
in reference to the latter might assign them a higher
place, on the whole they seem to occupy a lower position
than the conifers or the cordaiteæ of the Carboniferous.
In the Carboniferous some of the fern-like leaves assigned
to the genus <i>Noeggerathia</i> have been shown by Stur and
Weiss to have been gymnosperms, probably allied to
cycads, of which they may be regarded at least as precursors.
Thus the cycadean type does not really constitute
an advance in grade of organisation in the Mesozoic,
any further than that, in the period now in question, it
becomes much more developed in number and variety of
forms. But the conifers would seem to have had precedence
of it for a long time in the Palæozoic, and it replaces
in the Mesozoic the <i>Cordaites</i>, which in many respects
excelled it in complexity.</p>

<p>The greater part of the cycads of the Mesozoic age
would seem to have had short stems and to have constituted
the undergrowth of woods in which conifers attained
to greater height. An interesting case of this is
the celebrated dirt-bed of the quarries of the Isle of Portland,
long ago described by Dean Buckland. In this
fossil soil trunks of pines, which must have attained to
great height, are interspersed with the short, thick stems
of cycads, of the genus named <i>Cycadoidea</i> by Buckland,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">« 180 »</a></span>
and which from their appearance are called &ldquo;fossil
birds' nests&rdquo; by the quarrymen. Some, however, must
have attained a considerable height so as to resemble
palms.</p>

<p>The cycads, with their simple, thick trunks, usually
marked with rhombic scars, and bearing broad spreading
crowns of large, elegantly formed pinnate leaves, must
have formed a prominent part of the vegetation of the
northern hemisphere during the whole of the Mesozoic
period. A botanist, had there been such a person at the
time, would have found this to be the case everywhere
from the equator to Spitzbergen, and probably in the
southern hemisphere as well, and this throughout all the
long periods from the Early Trias to the Middle Cretaceous.
In a paper published in the &ldquo;Linnæan Transactions&rdquo;
for 1868, Dr. Carruthers enumerates twenty species
of British Mesozoic cycads, and the number might
now be considerably increased.</p>

</div>

<p>The pines present some features of interest. We have
already seen their connection with the broad-leaved <i>Cordaites</i>,
and in the Permian there are some additional
types of broad-leaved coniferæ.
In the Mesozoic we have great
numbers of beautiful trees,
with those elegant fan-shaped
leaves characteristic of but one
living species, the Salisburia,
or gingko-tree of China. It is
curious that this tree, though
now limited to eastern Asia,
will grow, though it rarely
fruits, in most parts of temperate
Europe, and in America as far north as Montreal,
and that in the Mesozoic period it occupied all these regions,
and even Siberia and Greenland, and with many
and diversified species (<a href="#fig66">Fig. 66</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">« 181 »</a></span></p>

<p><i>Salisburia</i> belongs to the yews, but an equally curious
fact applies to the cypresses. The genus <i>Sequoia</i>, limited
at present to two species, both Californian, and one of
them the so-called &ldquo;big tree,&rdquo; celebrated for the gigantic
size to which it attains, is represented by species found as
far back at least as the Lower Cretaceous, and in every
part of the northern hemisphere.<a name="FNanchor_DG_111" id="FNanchor_DG_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_DG_111" class="fnanchor">[DG]</a>
It seems to have
thriven in all these regions
throughout the Mesozoic
and early Kainozoic, and
then to have disappeared,
leaving only a small remnant
to represent it in
modern days. A number
of species have been described
from the Mesozoic
and Tertiary, all of them
closely related to those now
existing (<a href="#fig67">Fig. 67</a>).</p>

<p>The following notice of
these trees is for the most
part translated, with some
modifications and abridgment,
from a paper read
by the late Prof. Heer before
the Botanical Section
of the Swiss Natural History
Society:</p>

<p>The name itself deserves
consideration. It is that
of an Indian of the Cherokee tribe, Sequo Yah, who invented
an alphabet without any aid from the outside world
of culture, and taught it to his tribe by writing it upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">« 182 »</a></span>
leaves. This came into general use among the Cherokees,
before the white man had any knowledge of it; and
afterward, in 1828, a periodical was published in this
character by the missionaries. Sequo Yah was banished
from his home in Alabama, with the rest of his tribe, and
settled in New Mexico, where he died in 1843.</p>

<p>When Endlicher was preparing his synopsis of the
conifers, in 1846, and had established a number of new
genera, Dr. Jacbon Tschudi, then living with Endlicher,
brought before his notice this remarkable man, and asked
him to dedicate this red-wooded tree to the memory of a
literary genius so conspicuous among the red men of
America. Endlicher consented to do so, and only endeavored
to make the name pronounceable by changing
two of its letters.</p>

<p>Endlicher founded the genus on the redwood of the
Americans, <i>Taxodium sempervirens</i> of Lamb; and named
the species <i>Sequoia sempervirens</i>. These trees form large
forests in California, which extend along the coast as far
as Oregon. Trees are there met with of 300 feet in height
and 20 feet in diameter. The seeds have been brought
to Europe a number of years ago, and we already see in
upper Italy and around the Lake of Geneva, and in England,
high trees; but, on the other hand, they have not
proved successful around Zurich.</p>

<p>In 1852, a second species of Sequoia was discovered in
California, which, under the name of big tree, soon attained
a considerable celebrity. Lindley described it, in
1853, as <i>Wellingtonia gigantea</i>; and, in the following
year, Decaisne and Torrey proved that it belonged to
Sequoia, and that it accordingly should be called <i>Sequoia
gigantea</i>.</p>

<p>While the <i>Sequoia sempervirens</i>, in spite of the destructiveness
of the American lumbermen, still forms
large forests along the coast, the <i>Sequoia gigantea</i> is confined
to the isolated clumps which are met with inland at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">« 183 »</a></span>
a height of 5,000 to 7,000 feet above sea-level, and are
much sought after by tourists as one of the wonders of
the country. Reports came to Europe concerning the
largest of them which were quite fabulous, but we have
received accurate accounts of them from Prof. Whitney.
The tallest tree measured by him has a height of 325
feet, and in the case of one of the trees the number of the
rings of growth indicated an age of about 1,300 years.
It had a girth of 50 to 60 feet.</p>

<p>We know only two living species of <i>Sequoia</i>, both of
which are confined to California. The one (<i>S. sempervirens</i>)
is clothed with erect leaves, arranged in two rows,
very much like our yew-tree, and bears small, round
cones; the other (<i>S. gigantea</i>) has smaller leaves, set
closely against the branches, giving the tree more the appearance
of the cypress. The cones are egg-shaped, and
much larger. These two types are therefore sharply defined.</p>

<p>Both of these trees have an interesting history. If we
go back into the Tertiary, this same genus meets us with
a long array of species. Two of these species correspond
to those living at present: the <i>S. Langsdorfii</i> to the <i>S.
sempervirens</i>, and the <i>S. Couttsiæ</i> to the <i>S. gigantea</i>.<a name="FNanchor_DH_112" id="FNanchor_DH_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_DH_112" class="fnanchor">[DH]</a>
But, while the living species are confined to California, in
the Tertiary they are spread over several quarters of the
globe.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_DH_112" id="Footnote_DH_112"></a><a href="#FNanchor_DH_112"><span class="label">[DH]</span></a> <i>S. Couttsiæ</i> has leaves like <i>S. gigantea</i>, and cones like those of <i>8.
sempervirens</i>.</p></div>

<p>Let us first consider the <i>Sequoia Langsdorfii</i>. This
was first discovered in the lignite of Wetterau, and was
described as <i>Taxites langsdorfii</i>. Heer found it in the
upper Rhone district, and there lay beside the twigs
the remains of a cone, which showed that the <i>Taxites
Langsdorfii</i> of Brongniart belonged to the Californian
genus Sequoia established by Endlicher. He afterward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">« 184 »</a></span>
found much better preserved cones, together with seeds,
along with the plants of east Greenland, which fully
confirmed the determination. At Atanekerdluk in
Greenland (about 70° north latitude) this tree is very
common. The leaves, and also the flowers and numerous
cones, leave no doubt that it stands very near to the
modern redwood. It differs from it, however, in having
a much larger number of scales in the cone. The tree
is also found in Spitzbergen at nearly 78° north latitude,
where Nordenskiöld has collected, at Cape Lyell, wonderfully
preserved branches. From this high latitude the
species can be followed down through the whole of Europe
as far as the middle of Italy (at Senegaglia, Gulf of
Spezia). In Asia, also,, we can follow it to the steppes
of Kirghisen, to Possiet, and to the coast of the Sea of
Japan, and across to Alaska and Sitka. It is recognized
by Mr. Starkie Gardner as one of the species found in
the Eocene of Mull in the Hebrides.<a name="FNanchor_DI_113" id="FNanchor_DI_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_DI_113" class="fnanchor">[DI]</a> It is thus known
in Europe, Asia, and America, from 43° to 78° north
latitude, while its most nearly related living species, perhaps
even descended from it, is now confined to California.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_DI_113" id="Footnote_DI_113"></a><a href="#FNanchor_DI_113"><span class="label">[DI]</span></a> It is <i>Fareites Campbelli</i> of Forbes.</p></div>

<p>With this <i>S. Langsdorfii</i>, three other Tertiary species
are nearly related (<i>S. brevifolia</i>, Hr., <i>S. disticha</i>, Hr.,
and <i>S. Nordenskiöldi</i>, Hr.). These have been met with in
Greenland and Spitzbergen, and one of them has lately
been found in the United States. Three other species, in
addition to these, have been described by Lesquereux,
which appear to belong to the group of the <i>S. Langsdorfii</i>,
viz., <i>S. longifolia</i>, Lesq., <i>S. angustifolia</i>, and <i>S. acuminata</i>,
Lesq. Several species also occur in the Cretaceous
and Eocene of Canada.</p>

<p>These species thus answer to the living <i>Sequoia sempervirens</i>;
but we can also point to Tertiary representatives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">« 185 »</a></span>
of the <i>S. gigantea</i>. Their leases are stiff and
sharp-pointed, are thinly set round the branches, and lie
forward in the same way: the egg-shaped cones are in
some cases similar.</p>

<p>There are, however, in the early Tertiary six species,
which fill up the gap between <i>S. sempervirens</i> and <i>S.
gigantea</i>. They are the <i>S. Couttsiæ</i>, <i>S. affinis</i>, Lesq.,
<i>S. imbricata</i>, Hr., <i>S. sibirica</i>, Hr., <i>S. Heerii</i>, Lesq., and
<i>S. biformis</i>, Lesq. Of these, <i>S. Couttsiæ</i>, Hr., is the
most common and most important species. It has short
leaves, lying along the branch, like <i>S. gigantea</i>, and
small, round cones, like <i>S. Langsdorfii</i> and <i>sempervirens</i>.
Bovey Tracey in Devonshire has afforded splendid specimens
of cones, seeds, and twigs, which have been described
in the &ldquo;Philosophical Transactions.&rdquo; More lately, Count
Saporta has described specimens of cones and twigs from
Armissan. Specimens of this species have also been found
in the older Tertiary of Greenland, so that it must have
had a wide range. It is very like to the American <i>S.
affinis</i>, Lesq.</p>

<p>In the Tertiary there have been already found fourteen
well-marked species, which thus include representatives
of the two living types, <i>S. sempervirens</i> and <i>S. gigantea</i>.</p>

<p>We can follow this genus still further back. If we go
back to the Cretaceous age, we find ten species, of which
five occur in the Urgon of the Lower Cretaceous, two in
the Middle, and three in the Upper Cretaceous. Among
these, the Lower Cretaceous exhibits the two types of the
Sequoia sempervirens and <i>S. gigantea</i>. To the former
the <i>S. Smithiana</i> answers, and to the latter, the <i>Reichenbachii</i>,
Gein. The <i>S. Smithiana</i> stands indeed uncommonly
near the <i>S. Langsdorfii</i>, both in the appearance of
the leaves on the twigs and in the shape of the cones.
These are, however, smaller, and the leaves do not become
narrower toward the base. The <i>S. pectina</i>, Hr., of the
Upper Cretaceous, has its leaves arranged in two rows, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">« 186 »</a></span>
presents a similar appearance. The <i>S. Reichenbachii</i> is a
type more distinct from those now living and those in
the Tertiary. It has indeed stiff, pointed leaves, lying
forward, but they are arcuate, and the cones are smaller.
This tree has been known for a long time, and it serves
in the Cretaceous as a guiding star, which we can follow
from the Urgonian of the Lower Cretaceous up to the
Cenomanian. It is known in France, Belgium, Bohemia,
Saxony, Greenland, and Spitzbergen (also in Canada and
the United States). It has been placed in another genus&mdash;Geinitzia&mdash;but
we can recognise, by the help of the
cones, that it belongs to Sequoia.</p>

<p>Below this, there is found in Greenland a nearly related
species, the <i>S. ambigua</i>, Hr., of which the leaves
are shorter and broader, and the cones round and somewhat
smaller.</p>

<p>The connecting link between <i>S. Smithiana</i> and <i>Reichenbachii</i>
is formed by <i>S. subulata</i>, Hr., and <i>S. rigida</i>,
Hr., and three species (<i>S. gracilis</i>, Hr., <i>S. fastigiata</i> and
<i>S. Gardneriana</i>, Carr.), with leaves lying closely along the
branch, and which come very near to the Tertiary species
<i>S. Couttsiæ</i>. We have therefore in the Cretaceous quite
an array of species, which fill up the gap between the <i>S.
sempervirens</i> and <i>gigantea</i>, and show us that the genus
Sequoia had already attained a great development in the
Cretaceous. This was still greater in the Tertiary, in
which it also reached its maximum of geographical distribution.
Into the present world the two extremes of
the genus have alone continued; the numerous species
forming its main body have fallen out in the Tertiary.</p>

<p>If we look still further back, we find in the Jura a
great number of conifers, and, among them, we meet in
the genus Pinus with a type which is highly developed,
and which still survives; but for Sequoia we have till now
looked in vain, so that for the present we can not place
the rise of the genus lower than the Urgonian of the Cretaceous,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">« 187 »</a></span>
however remarkable we may think it that in that
period it should have developed into so many species; and
it is still more surprising that two species already make
their appearance which approach so near to the living
<i>Sequoia sempervirens</i> and <i>S. gigantea</i>.</p>

<p>Altogether, we have become acquainted, up to the
present time, with twenty-six species of Sequoia. Fourteen
of these species are found in the Arctic zone, and
have been described and figured in the &ldquo;Fossil Flora
of the Arctic Regions.&rdquo; Sequoia has been recognised by
Ettingshausen even in Australia, but there in the Eocene.</p>

<p>This is, perhaps, the most remarkable record in the
whole history of vegetation. The Sequoias are the giants
of the conifers, the grandest representatives of the family,
and the fact that, after spreading over the whole northern
hemisphere and attaining to more than twenty specific
forms, their decaying remnant should now be confined to
one limited region in western America and to two species
constitutes a sad memento of departed greatness.<a name="FNanchor_DJ_114" id="FNanchor_DJ_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_DJ_114" class="fnanchor">[DJ]</a> The
small remnant of <i>S. gigantea</i> still, however, towers above
all competitors, as eminently the &ldquo;big trees &rdquo;; but, had
they and the allied species failed to escape the Tertiary
continental submergences and the disasters of the glacial
period, this grand genus would have been to us an extinct
type. In like manner the survival of the single gingko
of eastern Asia alone enables us to understand that
great series of taxine trees with fern-like leaves of which
it is the sole representative.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_DJ_114" id="Footnote_DJ_114"></a><a href="#FNanchor_DJ_114"><span class="label">[DJ]</span></a> The writer has shown that much of the material of the great lignite
beds of the Canadian Northwest consists of wood of Sequoia of both the
modern types.</p></div>

<p>Besides these peculiar and now rare forms, we have in
the Mesozoic many others related closely to existing yews,
cypresses, pines, and spruces, so that the conifers were
probably in greater abundance and variety than they are
at this day.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">« 188 »</a></span></p>

<p>In this period, also, we find the earliest representatives
of the endogenous plants. It is true that some plants
found in the coal-formation have been doubtfully referred
to these, but the earliest certain examples would
seem to be some bamboo-like and screw-pine-like plants
occurring in the Jurassic rocks. Some of these are, it is
true, doubtful forms, but of others there seems to be no
question. The modern <i>Pandanus</i> or screw-pine of the
tropical regions, which is not a pine, however, but a
humble relation of the palms, is a stiffly branching tree,
of a candelabra-like form, and with tufts of long leaves
on its branches, and nuts or great hard berries for fruit,
borne sometimes in large masses, and so protected as to
admit of their drifting uninjured on the sea. The stems
are supported by masses of aërial roots like those which
strengthen the stems of tree-ferns. These structures and
habits of growth fit the Pandanus for its especial habitat
on the shores of tropical islands, to which its masses of
nuts are drifted by the winds and currents, and on whose
shores it can establish itself by the aid of its aërial roots.</p>

<p>Some plants referred to the cycads have proved veritable
botanical puzzles. One of these, the <i>Williamsonia
gigas</i> of the English oölite, originally discovered by my
friend Dr. Williamson, and named by him <i>Zamia gigas</i>, a
very tall and beautiful species, found in rocks of this age in
various parts of Europe, has been claimed by Saporta for
the Endogens, as a plant allied to <i>Pandanus</i>. Some
other botanists have supposed the flowers and fruits to be
parasites on other plants, like the modern <i>Rafflesia</i> of
Sumatra, but it is possible that after all it may prove to
have been an aberrant cycad.</p>

<p>The tree-palms are not found earlier than the Middle
Cretaceous, where we shall notice them in the next chapter.
In like manner, though a few Angiosperms occur
in rocks believed to be Lower or Lower Middle Cretaceous
in Greenland and the northwest territory of Canada, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">« 189 »</a></span>
in Virginia, these are merely precursors of those of the
Upper Cretaceous, and are not sufficient to redeem the
earlier Cretaceous from being a period of pines and cycads.</p>

<p>On the whole, this early Mesozoic flora, so far as
known to us, has a monotonous and mean appearance.
It no doubt formed vast forests of tall pines, perhaps resembling
the giant Sequoias of California; but they must
for the most part have been dark and dismal woods,
probably tenanted by few forms of life, for the great reptiles
of this age must have preferred the open and sunny
coasts, and many of them dwelt in the waters. Still we
must not be too sure of this. The berries and nuts of the
numerous yews and cycads were capable of affording
much food. We know that in this age there were many
great herbivorous reptiles, like <i>Iguanodon</i> and <i>Hadrosaurus</i>,
some of them fitted by their structure to feed upon
the leaves and fruits of trees. There were also several
kinds of small herbivorous mammals, and much insect
life, and it is likely that few of the inhabitants of the
Mesozoic woods have been preserved as fossils. We may
yet have much to learn of the inhabitants of these forests
of ferns, cycads, and pines. We must not forget in this
connection that in the present day there are large islands,
like New Zealand, destitute of mammalia, and having a
flora comparable with that of the Mesozoic in the northern
hemisphere, though more varied. We have also the remarkable
example of Australia, with a much richer flora
than that of the early Mesozoic, yet inhabited only by
non-placental mammals, like those of the Mesozoic.</p>

<p>The principal legacy that the Mesozoic woods have
handed down to our time is in some beds of coal, locally
important, but of far less extent than those of the Carboniferous
period. Still, in America, the Richmond coal-field
in Virginia is of this age, and so are the anthracite
beds of the Queen Charlotte Islands, on the west coast of
Canada, and the coal of Brora in Sutherlandshire. Valuable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">« 190 »</a></span>
beds of coal, probably of this age, also exist in China,
India, and South Africa; and jet, which is so extensively
used for ornament, is principally derived from the carbonised
remains of the old Mesozoic pines.</p>

<p>In the next chapter we have to study a revolution in
vegetable life most striking and unique, in the advent of
the forest-trees of strictly modern types.</p>

Greenland. One of the
oldest known Angiosperms.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a remarkable fact in geological chronology that
the culmination of the vegetable kingdom antedates that
of the animal. The placental mammals, the highest
group of the animal kingdom, are not known till the beginning
of the Eocene Tertiary. The dicotyledonous
Angiosperms, which correspond
to them in the vegetable kingdom,
occur far earlier&mdash;in the
beginning of the Upper Cretaceous
or close of the Lower
Cretaceous. The reign of cycads
and pines holds throughout
the Lower Cretaceous, but
at the close of that age there is
a sudden incoming of the higher
plants, and a proportionate
decrease, more especially of the
cycads.</p>

<p>I have already referred to the
angiospermous wood supposed
to be Devonian, but I fear to
rest any conclusion on this isolated
fact. Beyond this, the earliest indications of
plants of this class have been found in the Lower
Cretaceous. Many years ago Heer described and figured
the leaves of a poplar (<i>Populus primæva</i>) from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">« 192 »</a></span>
the supposed Lower Cretaceous of Komé, in Greenland
(<a href="#fig68">Fig. 68</a>). Two species, a <i>Sterculia</i> and a <i>Laurus</i> or
<i>Salix</i>, occur among fossils described by me in the upper
part of the Kootanie series of the Rocky Mountains, and
Fontaine has recently found in the Potomac group of
Virginia&mdash;believed to be of Neocomian age&mdash;several angiospermous
species (<i>Sassafras</i>, <i>Menispermites</i>, <i>Sapindus</i>,
<i>Aralia</i>, <i>Populus</i>, &amp;c.) mixed with a rich flora of cycads
and pines. These are the early forerunners of the modern
angiospermous flora; but so far as known they do
not occur below the Cretaceous, and in its lower portions
only very rarely. When, however, we ascend into the
Upper Cretaceous, whether of Europe or America, there
is a remarkable incoming of the higher plants, under
generic forms similar to those now existing. This is, in
truth, the advent of the modern flora of the temperate
regions of the earth. A very interesting tabular view of
its early distribution is given by Ward, in the &ldquo;American
Journal of Science&rdquo; for 1884, of which the following is a
synopsis, with slight emendations. I may add that the
new discoveries made since 1884 would probably tend to
increase the proportionate number of dicotyledons in the
newer groups.</p>

<p>Thus we have a great and sudden inswarming of the
higher plants of modern types at the close of the Lower
Cretaceous. In relation to this, Saporta, one of the most
enthusiastic of evolutionists, is struck by this phenomenon
of the sudden appearance of so many forms, and
some of them the most highly differentiated of dicotyledonous
plants. The early stages of their evolution may,
he thinks, have been obscure and as yet unobserved, or
they may have taken place in some separate region, or
mother country as yet undiscovered, or they may have
been produced by a rapid and unusual multiplication of
flower-haunting insects! Or it is even conceivable that
the apparently sudden elevation of plants may have been
due to causes still unknown. This last seems, indeed,
the only certain inference in the case, since, as Saporta
proceeds to say in conclusion: &ldquo;Whatever hypothesis
one may prefer, the fact of the rapid multiplication of
dicotyledons, and of their simultaneous appearance in
a great number of places in the northern hemisphere at
the beginning of the Cenomanian epoch, cannot be disputed.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_DL_116" id="FNanchor_DL_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_DL_116" class="fnanchor">[DL]</a></p>

<p>The leaves described by Heer, from the Middle Cretaceous
of Greenland, are those of a poplar (<i>P. primæva</i>).
Those which I have described from a corresponding horizon
in the Rocky Mountains are a <i>Sterculites</i> (<i>S. vetustula</i>),
probably allied to the mallows, and an elongated
leaf, <i>Laurophyllum</i> (<i>L. crassinerve</i>) (<a href="#fig69">Fig. 69</a>), which
may, however, have belonged to a willow rather than a
laurel. These are certainly older than the Dakota group
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">« 194 »</a></span>
of the United States and the corresponding formations
in Canada. On the eastern side of the American continent,
in Virginia, the Potomac series is supposed to be
of Lower Cretaceous age,
and here Fontaine, as
already stated, has found
an abundant flora of cycads,
conifers, and ferns,
with a few angiospermous
leaves, which have
not yet been described.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 233px;">

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 69.&mdash;<i>Stercalia</i> and <i>Laurophyllum</i>

</div>

<p>In the Canadian Rocky
Mountains, a few hundreds
of feet above the
beds holding the beforementioned
species, are the
shales of the Mill Creek
series, rich in many species
of dicotyledonous
leaves, and corresponding in age with the Dakota group,
whose fossils have been so well described, first by Heer
and Capellini, and afterward by Lesquereux. We may
take this Dakota group and the quader-sand stone of Germany
as types of the plant-bearing Cenomanian, and may
notice the forms occurring in them.</p>

<p>In the first place, we recognise here the successors of
our old friends, the ferns and the pines, the latter represented
by such genera as <i>Taxites</i>, <i>Sequoia</i>, <i>Glyptostrobus</i>,
<i>Gingko</i>, and even <i>Pinus</i> itself. We also have a few
cycads, but not so dominant as in the previous ages.
The fan-palms are well represented, both in America and
in the corresponding series in Europe, especially by the
genus <i>Sabal</i>, which is the characteristic American type of
fan-palm, and there is one genus which Saporta regards
as intermediate between the fan-palms and the pinnately
leaved species. There are also many fragments of stems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">« 195 »</a></span>
and leaves of carices and grasses, so that these plants, now
so important to the nourishment of man and his companion
animals, were already represented.</p>

</div>

<p>But the great feature of the time was its dicotyledonous
forests, and I have only to enumerate the genera
supposed to be represented in order to show the richness
of the time in plants of this type. It may be necessary
to explain here that the generic names used are mostly
based on leaves, and consequently cannot be held as being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">« 196 »</a></span>
absolutely certain, since we know that at present one
genus may have considerable variety in its leaves, and, on
the other hand, that plants of different genera may be
very much alike in their foliage. There is, however, undoubtedly
a likeness in plan or type of structure in leaves
of closely allied plants, and, therefore, if judiciously
studied, they can be determined with at least approximate
certainty.<a name="FNanchor_DM_117" id="FNanchor_DM_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_DM_117" class="fnanchor">[DM]</a> More especially we can attain to much
certainty when the fruits as well as the leaves are found,
and when we can obtain specimens of the wood, showing
its structure. Such corroboration is not wanting, though
unfortunately the leaves of trees are generally found
drifted away from the other organs once connected with
them. In my own experience, however, I have often
found determinations of the leaves of trees confirmed by
the discovery of their fruits or of the structure of their
stems. Thus, in the rich cretaceous plant-beds of the
Dunvegan series we have beech-nuts associated in the
same beds with leaves referred to <i>Fagus</i>. In the Laramie
beds I determined many years ago nuts of the <i>Trapa</i>
or water-chestnut, and subsequently Lesquereux found,
in beds in the United States, leaves which he referred to
the same genus. Later, I found in collections made on
the Red Deer River of Canada my fruits and Lesquereux&rsquo;s
leaves on the same slab. The presence of trees of the
genera <i>Carya</i> and <i>Juglans</i> in the same formation was inferred
from their leaves, and specimens have since been
obtained of silicified wood, with the microscopic structure
of the modern butternut. Still we are willing to admit
that determinations from leaves alone are liable to doubt.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_DM_117" id="Footnote_DM_117"></a><a href="#FNanchor_DM_117"><span class="label">[DM]</span></a> Great allowance has to be made for the variability of leaves of the
same species. The modern hazel (<i>C. rostrata</i>) is a case in point. Its
leaves, from different parts of the same plant, are so dissimilar in form
and size that they might readily be regarded as of different species.</p></div>

<p>In the matter of names of fossil leaves, I sympathise
very strongly with Dr. Nathorst, of Stockholm, in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">« 197 »</a></span>
objection to the use of modern generic names for mere
leaves, and would be quite content to adopt some non-committal
termination, as that of &ldquo;<i>phyllum</i>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<i>ites</i>&rdquo;
suggested by him. I feel, however, that almost as much
is taken for granted if a plant is called Corylophyllum or
<i>Corylites</i>, as if called <i>Corylus</i>. In either case a judgment
is expressed as to its affinities, which if wrong under the
one term is wrong under the other; and after so much has
been done by so many eminent botanists, it seems inexpedient
to change the whole nomenclature for so small
and questionable an advantage. I wish it, however, to
be distinctly understood that plants catalogued on the
evidence of leaves alone are for the most part referred to
certain genera on grounds necessarily imperfect, and
their names are therefore subject to correction, as new
facts may be obtained.</p>

<p>The more noteworthy modern genera included in the
Dakota flora, as catalogued by Lesquereux, are the following:
<i>Liquidambar</i>, the sweet-gum, is represented both in
America and Europe, the leaves resembling those of the
modern species, but with entire edges, which seems to be
a common peculiarity of Cretaceous foliage.<a name="FNanchor_DN_118" id="FNanchor_DN_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_DN_118" class="fnanchor">[DN]</a> <i>Populus</i>
(poplar), as already stated, appears very early in Greenland,
and continues with increasing number of species
throughout the Cretaceous and Tertiary. <i>Salix</i> (willow)
appears only a little later and continues. Of the family
<i>Cupuliferæ</i> we have <i>Fagus</i> (beech), <i>Quercus</i> (oak), and
<i>Castanea</i> (chestnut), which appear together in the Dakota
group and its equivalents. Fruits of some of the species
are known, and also wood showing structure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">« 198 »</a></span><i>Betula</i>
(birch) is represented by a few species, and specimens of
its peculiar bark are also common. <i>Alnus</i> (alder) appears
in one species at least. The genus Plat anus (<a href="#fig71">Fig. 71</a>),
that of the plane-trees, represented at present by one
European and one American species, has several species
in the Cretaceous, though the plane-trees seem to culminate
in the early part of the succeeding Eocene, where
there are several species with immense leaves. The large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">« 199 »</a></span>
leaves, known as <i>Credneria</i>, found in the Cenomanian of
Europe, and those called <i>Protophyllum</i> (<a href="#fig72">Fig. 72</a>) in
America, appear to be nearer to the plane-trees than to
any others, though representing an extinct type. The
laurels are represented in this age, and the American
genus Sassafras, which has now only one species, has not
one merely but several species in the Cretaceous. <i>Diospyros</i>,
the persimmon-tree, was also a Cretaceous genus.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_DN_118" id="Footnote_DN_118"></a><a href="#FNanchor_DN_118"><span class="label">[DN]</span></a> With reference to this, something may be learned from the leaves
of modern trees. In these, young shoots have leaves often less toothed
and serrated than those of the adult tree. A remarkable instance is the
<i>Populus grandidentatus</i> of America, the young shoots of which have entire
leaves, quite unlike except in venation those of the parent tree, and
having an aspect very similar to that of the Cretaceous poplars.</p></div>

<p>The single species of the beautiful <i>Liriodendron</i>, or tulip-tree,
is a remnant of a genus which had several Cretaceous
species (Figs. <a href="#fig74">74</a>, <a href="#fig75">75</a>). The magnolias, still well represented
in the American flora, were equally plentiful in the
Cretaceous (<a href="#fig73">Fig. 73</a>). The walnut family were well represented
by species of <i>Juglans</i> (butternut) and <i>Carya</i>, or
hickory. In all, no less than forty-eight genera are present
belonging to at least twenty-five families, running
through the whole range of the dicotyledonous exogens.
This is a remarkable result, indicating a sudden profusion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">« 200 »</a></span>
of forms of these plants of a very striking character. It
is further to be observed that some of the genera have
many species in the Cretaceous
and dwindle toward
the modern. In
others the reverse is the
case&mdash;they have expanded
in modern times. In
a number there seems to
have been little change.</p>

<p>Dr. Newberry has
given, in the &ldquo;Bulletin
of the Torrey Botanical
Club&rdquo; an interesting
<i>résumé</i> of the history
of the beautiful <i>Liriodendron</i>,
or tulip-tree,
which may be taken as
an example of a genus
which has gone down
in importance in the
course of its geological
history.</p>

<p>"The genus <i>Liriodendron</i>,
as all botanists
know, is represented
in the present flora
by a single species, &lsquo;the
tulip-tree&rsquo; which is confined
to eastern America,
but grows over all
the area lying between
the Lakes and the Gulf,
the Mississippi and the
Atlantic. It is a magnificent
tree, on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">« 201 »</a></span>
whole, the finest in our forests. Its cylindrical trunk,
sometimes ten feet in diameter, carries it beyond all its
associates in size, while the beauty of its glossy, lyre-shaped
leaves and tulip-like
flowers is only surpassed
by the flowers and
foliage of its first cousin,
<i>Magnolia grandiflora</i>.
That a plant so splendid
should stand quite alone in the vegetation of the present
day excited the wonder of the earlier botanists, but the
sassafras, the sweet-gum, and the great Sequoias of the far
West afford similar examples of isolation, and the latter
are still more striking illustrations of solitary grandeur."
(Figs. <a href="#fig74">74</a> and <a href="#fig75">75</a>.)</p>

<p>"Three species of <i>Liriodendron</i> are indicated by leaves
found in the Amboy clays&mdash;Middle Cretaceous&mdash;of New
Jersey, and others have been obtained from the Dakota
group in the West, and from the Upper Cretaceous strata
of Greenland. Though differing considerably among
themselves in size and form, all these have the deep sinus
of the upper extremity so characteristic of the genus,
and the nervation is also essentially the same. Hence,
we must conclude that the genus <i>Liriodendron</i>, now represented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">« 202 »</a></span>
by a single species, was in the Cretaceous age
much more largely developed, having many species, and
those scattered throughout many lands. In the Tertiary
age the genus continued to exist, but the species seem to
have been reduced to one, which is hardly to be distinguished
from that now living. In many parts of Europe
leaves of the tulip-tree have been found, and it extended
as far south as Italy. Its presence there was first made
known by Unger, in his &lsquo;Synopsis,&rsquo; page 232, and in his
&lsquo;Genera et Species,&rsquo; page 443, where he describes it
under the name of <i>Liriodendron procaccinii</i>. The genus
has also been noticed in Europe by Massalongo, Heer, and
Ettingshausen, and three species have been distinguished.
All these are, however, so much like the living species
that they should probably be united with it. We here
have a striking illustration of the wide distribution of a
species which has retained its characters both of fruit and
leaf quite unchanged through long migrations and an
enormous lapse of time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Europe the tulip-tree, like many of its American
associates, seems to have been destroyed by the cold of
the Ice period, the Mediterranean cutting off its retreat,
but in America it migrated southward over the southern
extension of the continent and returned northward again
with the amelioration of the climate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaves of <i>Liriodendron</i> have been recognised in the
Cretaceous of Greenland, though it is now a tree of
the warm temperate region, and Lesquereux describes
several species from the Dakota group. But the genus
has not yet been recognised in the Laramie or in the
Upper Cretaceous of British Columbia. In the paper
above quoted, Newberry describes three new species
from the Amboy clays, one of which he considers identical
with a Greenland form referred by Heer to <i>L.
Meekii</i> of the Dakota group. Thus, if all Lesquereux&rsquo;s
species are to be accepted, the genus begins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">« 203 »</a></span>
in the Middle Cretaceous with at least nine American
species.</p>

<p>In New Jersey the Amboy clays are referred to the
same age with the Dakota beds of the West. In these
Dr. Newberry has found a rich flora, including many
angiosperms. The following is condensed from a preliminary
notice in the &ldquo;Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical
Club&rdquo;:<a name="FNanchor_DO_119" id="FNanchor_DO_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_DO_119" class="fnanchor">[DO]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_DO_119" id="Footnote_DO_119"></a><a href="#FNanchor_DO_119"><span class="label">[DO]</span></a> March, 1886.</p></div>

<p>"The flora of the Amboy clays is closely related to
that of the Dakota group&mdash;most of the genera and some
of the species being identical&mdash;so that we may conclude
they were nearly contemporaneous, though the absence in
New Jersey of the Fort Benton and Niobrara groups of
the upper Missouri and the apparent synchronism of the
New Jersey marls and the Pierre group indicate that the
Dakota is a little the older.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least one-third of the species of the Amboy clays
seem to be identical with leaves found in the Upper Cretaceous
clays of Greenland and Aachen (Aix la Chapelle),
which not only indicates a chronological parallelism, but
shows a remarkable and unexpected similarity in the vegetation
of these widely separated countries in the middle
and last half of the Cretaceous age. The botanical character
of the flora of the Amboy clays will be seen from the
following brief synopsis:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Algæ.</i>&mdash;A small and delicate form, allied to Chondrites.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Ferns.</i>&mdash;Twelve species, generally similar and in
part identical with those described by Heer from the
Cretaceous beds of Greenland, and referred to the genera
<i>Dicksonia</i>, <i>Gleichenia</i>, and <i>Aspidium</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Cycads.</i>&mdash;Two species, probably identical with the
forms from Greenland described by Heer under the
names of <i>Podozamites marginatus</i> and <i>P. tenuinervis</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">« 204 »</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Conifers.</i>&mdash;Fourteen species, belonging to the genera
<i>Moriconia</i>, <i>Brachyphyllum</i>, <i>Cunninghamites</i>, <i>Pinus</i>, <i>Sequoia</i>,
and others referred by Heer to <i>Juniperus</i>, <i>Libocedrus</i>,
<i>Frenelopsis</i>, <i>Thuya</i>, and <i>Dammara</i>. Of these,
the most abundant and most interesting are <i>Moriconia
cyclotoxon</i>&mdash;the most beautiful of conifers&mdash;and <i>Cunninghamites
elegans</i>, both of which occur in the Cretaceous
clays of Aachen, Prussia, and Patoot, Greenland. The
<i>Brachyphyllum</i> was a large and strong species, with imbricated
cones, eight inches in length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The angiosperms form about seventy species, which
include three of <i>Magnolia</i>, four of <i>Liriodendron</i>, three or
four of <i>Salix</i>, three of <i>Celastrophyllum</i> (of which one is
identical with a Greenland species), one <i>Celastrus</i> (also
found in Greenland), four or five <i>Aralias</i>, two <i>Sassafras</i>,
one <i>Cinnamomum</i>, one <i>Hedera</i>; with leaves that are apparently
identical with those described by Heer as belonging
to <i>Andromeda</i>, <i>Cissites</i>, <i>Cornus</i>, <i>Dewalquea</i>, <i>Diospyros</i>,
<i>Eucalyptus</i>, <i>Ficus</i>, <i>Ilex</i>, <i>Juglans</i>, <i>Laurus</i>, <i>Menispermites</i>,
<i>Myrica</i>, <i>Myrsine</i>, <i>Prunus</i>, <i>Rhamnus</i>, and
others not yet determined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of the Aralias had palmately-lobed leaves,
nearly a foot in diameter, and two of the tulip-trees
(<i>Liriodendron</i>) had leaves quite as large as those of the
living species. One of these had deeply lobed leaves, like
those of the white oak. Of the other, the leaves resembled
those of the recent tulip-tree, but were larger. Both
had the peculiar emargination and the nervation of <i>Liriodendron</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Among the most interesting plants of the collection
are fine species of <i>Bauhinia</i> and <i>Hymenæa</i>. Of these,
the first is represented by a large number of leaves, some
of which are six or seven inches in diameter. They are
deeply bilobed, and have the peculiar and characteristic
form and nervation of the leaves of this genus. <i>Bauhinia</i>
is a leguminous genus allied to <i>Cercis</i>, and now inhabits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">« 205 »</a></span>
tropical and warm temperate climates in both
hemispheres. Only one species occurs in the United
States, <i>Bauhinia lunarioides</i>, Gray, found by Dr. Bigelow
on the Rio Grande.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Hymenæa</i> is another of the leguminosæ, and inhabits
tropical America. A species of this genus has been
found in the Upper Cretaceous of France, but quite different
from the one before us, in which the leaves are
much larger, and the leaflets are united in a common
petiole, which is winged; this is a modification not found
in the living species, and one which brings it nearer to
<i>Bauhinia</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the most surprising discovery yet made is that
of a number of quite large helianthoid flowers, which I
have called <i>Palæanthus</i>. These are three to four inches
in diameter, and exhibit a scaly involucre, enclosing what
much resembles a fleshy receptacle with achenia. From
the border of this radiate a number of ray florets, one to
two inches in length, which are persistent and must have
been scarious, like those of <i>Helichrysum</i>. Though these
flowers so much resemble those of the compositæ, we are
not yet warranted in asserting that such is certainly their
character. In the Jurassic rocks of Europe and India
some flowers not very unlike these have been found, which
have been named <i>Williamsonia</i>, and referred to cycads by
Carruthers. A similar fossil has been found in the Cretaceous
rocks of Greenland, and named by Heer <i>Williamsonia
cretacea</i>, but he questions the reference of the genus
to the Cycadeæ, and agrees with Nathorst in considering
all the species of <i>Williamsonia</i> as parasitic flowers, allied
to <i>Brugmansia</i> or <i>Rafflesia</i>. The Marquis of Saporta
regards them as monocotyledons, similar to <i>Pandanus</i>.
More specimens of the flowers now exhibited will perhaps
prove&mdash;what we can now only regard as probable&mdash;that
the Compositæ, like the <i>Leguminosæ</i>, <i>Magnoliaceæ</i>, <i>Celastraceæ</i>,
and other highly organised plants, formed part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">« 206 »</a></span>
of the Cretaceous flora. No composite flowers have before
been found in the fossil state, and, as these are among
the most complex and specialised forms of florescence, it
has been supposed that they belonged only to the recent
epoch, where they were the result of a long series of formative
changes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The above presents some interesting new types not
heretofore found in the Middle Cretaceous. More especially
the occurrence of large flowers of the composite
type presents a startling illustration of the early appearance
of a very elevated and complex form. Great interest
also attaches to these Amboy beds, as serving, with those
of Aix and Greenland, to show that the margins of the
Atlantic were occupied with a flora similar to that occurring
at the same time in the interior plateau of North
America and on the Pacific slope.</p>

<p>The beds at Aix-la-Chapelle are, however, probably
somewhat newer than the Dakota or Amboy beds, and
correspond more nearly in age with those of the Cretaceous
coal-field of Vancouver Island, where there is a very
rich Upper Cretaceous flora, which I have noticed in detail
in the &ldquo;Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_DP_120" id="FNanchor_DP_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_DP_120" class="fnanchor">[DP]</a>
In these Upper Cretaceous beds there are fan-palms
as far north at least as the latitude of 49°, indicating
a very mild climate at this period. This inference is
corroborated by the Upper Cretaceous flora of Atané and
Patoot in Greenland, as described by Heer.</p>

<p>The dicotyledonous plants above referred to are trees
and shrubs. Of the herbaceous exogens of the period we
know less. Obviously their leaves are less likely to find
their way into aqueous deposits than the leaves of trees.
They are, besides, more perishable, and in densely wooded
countries there are comparatively few herbaceous plants.
I have examined the beds of mud deposited at the mouth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">« 207 »</a></span>
of a woodland streamlet, and have found them stored with
the fallen leaves of trees, but it was in vain to search for
the leaves of herbaceous plants.</p>

<p>The climate of North America and Europe, represented
by the Cenomanian vegetation, is not tropical but warm
temperate; but the flora was more uniform than at present,
indicating a very equable climate and the possibility
of temperate genera existing within the Arctic circle, and
it would seem to have become warmer toward the close of
the period.</p>

<p>The flora of the Cenomanian is separated in most
countries from that of the Senonian, or uppermost Cretaceous,
by a marine formation holding few plants. This
depends on great movements of elevation and depression,
to which we must refer in the sequel. In a few regions,
however, as in the vicinity of the Peace River in Canada,
there are plant-bearing beds which serve to bridge over
the interval between the
Early Cenomanian and
the later Cretaceous.<a name="FNanchor_DQ_121" id="FNanchor_DQ_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_DQ_121" class="fnanchor">[DQ]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_DQ_121" id="Footnote_DQ_121"></a><a href="#FNanchor_DQ_121"><span class="label">[DQ]</span></a> See paper by the author in the &ldquo;Transactions of the Royal Society
of Canada,&rdquo; 1882.</p></div>

<p>To this interval also
would seem to belong
the Belly River series of
western Canada, which
contains important beds
of Coal, but is Closely associated
with the marine
Fort Pierre series. A
very curious herbaceous
plant of this group, which I have named <i>Brasenia antiqua</i>,
occurs in the beds associated with one of the coals.
It is a close ally of the modern <i>B. peltata</i>, an aquatic
plant which occurs in British Columbia and in eastern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">« 208 »</a></span>
America, and is also said to be found in Japan, Australia,
and India, a width of distribution appropriate to so old
a type (<a href="#fig76">Fig. 76</a>).</p>

<p>In so far as vegetable life is concerned, the transition
from the Upper Cretaceous to the Tertiary or Kainozoic
is easy, though in many parts of the world, and more
especially in western Europe, there is a great gap in the
deposits between the upper Chalk and the lowest Eocene.
With reference to fossil plants, Schimper recognises in
the Kainozoic, beginning with the oldest, five formations&mdash;Palæocene,
Eocene, Oligocene, Miocene, and Pliocene.
Throughout these a flora, similar to that of the Cretaceous
on the one hand and the modern on the other,
though with important local peculiarities, extends. There
is evidence, however, of a gradual refrigeration, so that
in the Pliocene the climates of the northern hemisphere
were not markedly different from their present character.</p>

<p>In the first instance an important error was committed
by palæobotanists, in referring to the Miocene
many deposits really belonging to the Eocene. This
arose from the early study of the rich plant-bearing
Miocene beds of Switzerland, and from the similarity of
the flora all the way from the Middle Cretaceous to the
later Tertiary. The differences are now being worked
out, and we owe to Mr. Starkie Gardner the credit of
pointing these out in England, and to the Geological
Survey of Canada that of collecting the material for
exhibiting them in the more northern part of America.</p>

<p>In the great interior plain of America there rests
on the Cretaceous a series of clays and sandstones with
beds of lignite, some of them eighteen feet in thickness.
This was formerly known as the lignitic or lignite Tertiary,
but more recently as the Laramie series. These
beds were deposited in fresh or brackish water, in an
internal sea or group of lakes and swamps, when the
continent was lower than at present. They have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">« 209 »</a></span>
studied both in the United States<a name="FNanchor_DR_122" id="FNanchor_DR_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_DR_122" class="fnanchor">[DR]</a> and Canada; and,
though their flora was originally referred by mistake to
the Miocene, it is now known to be Eocene or Palæocene,
or even in part a transition group between the latter and
the Cretaceous. The following remarks, taken chiefly
from recent papers by the author,<a name="FNanchor_DS_123" id="FNanchor_DS_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_DS_123" class="fnanchor">[DS]</a> will serve to illustrate
this:</p>

and Newberry, and a recent memoir by Ward on &ldquo;Types of the

<p>On the geological map of Canada the Laramie series,
formerly known as the lignitic or lignite Tertiary, occurs,
with the exception of a few outliers, in two large
areas west of the 100th meridian, and separated from each
other by a tract of older Cretaceous rocks, over which the
Laramie beds may have extended, before the later denudation
of the region.</p>

<p>The most eastern of these areas, that of the Souris
River and Wood Mountain, extends for some distance
along the United States boundary, between the 102d and
109th meridians, and reaches northward to about thirty
miles south of the &ldquo;elbow&rdquo; of the South Saskatchewan
River, which is on the parallel of 51° north. In this
area the lowest beds of the Laramie are seen to rest on
those of the Fox Hill group of the Upper Cretaceous,
and at one point on the west they are overlaid by beds of
Miocene Tertiary age, observed by Mr. McConnell, of
the Geological Survey, in the Cypress Hills, and referred

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">« 210 »</a></span>
Miocene. They are also undoubtedly continuous with
the Fort Union group of the United States geologists on
the other side of the international boundary, and they
contain similar fossil plants. They are divisible into two
groups&mdash;a lower, mostly argillaceous, and to which the
name of &ldquo;Bad Lands beds&rdquo; may be given, from the &ldquo;bad
lands&rdquo; of Wood Mountain, where they are well exposed,
and an upper, partly arenaceous member, which may be
named the Souris River or Porcupine Creek division.
In the lower division are found reptilian remains of Upper
Cretaceous type, with some fish remains more nearly akin
to those of the Eocene.<a name="FNanchor_DU_125" id="FNanchor_DU_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_DU_125" class="fnanchor">[DU]</a> Neither division has as yet
afforded mammalian remains.</p>

<p>The western area is of still larger dimensions, and extends
along the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains from
the United States boundary to about the 55th parallel of
latitude, and stretches eastward to the 111th meridian.
In this area, and more especially in its southern part, the
officers of the Geological Survey of Canada have recognised
three divisions, as follows: (1) The Lower Laramie
or St. Mary River series, corresponding in its character
and fossils to the Lower or Bad Lands division of the
other area. (2) A middle division, the Willow Creek
beds, consisting of clays, mostly reddish, and not recognised
in the other area. (3) The Upper Laramie or
Porcupine Hills division, corresponding in fossils, and to
some extent in mineral character, to the Souris River
beds of the eastern area.</p>

<p>The fossil plants collected by Dr. G. M. Dawson in
the eastern area were noticed by the author in an appendix
to Dr. Dawson&rsquo;s report on the 49th parallel, in 1875,
and a collection subsequently made by Dr. Selwyn was
described in the &ldquo;Report of the Geological Survey of
Canada&rdquo; for 1879-'80. Those of the western area, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">« 211 »</a></span>
especially collections made by myself near Calgary in
1883, and by officers of the Geological Survey in 1884,
have been described in the &ldquo;Transactions of the Royal
Society of Canada&rdquo; vols. iii. and iv.</p>

<p>In studying these fossil plants, I have found that
there is a close correspondence between those of the
Lower and Upper Laramie in the two areas above referred
to respectively, and that the flora of the Lower
Laramie is somewhat distinct from that of the Upper,
the former being especially rich in certain aquatic plants,
and the latter much more copious on the whole, and
much more rich in remains of forest-trees. This is, however,
possibly an effect rather of local conditions than of
any considerable change in the flora, since some Upper
Laramie forms recur as low as the Belly River series of the
Cretaceous, which is believed on stratigraphical grounds
to be considerably older than the Lower Laramie.</p>

<p>With reference to the correlation of these beds with
those of the United States, some difficulty has arisen from
the tendency of palæobotanists to refer the plants of the
Upper Laramie to the Miocene age, although in the reports
of Mr. Clarence King, the late director of the
United States Geological Survey, these beds are classed,
on the evidence of stratigraphy and animal fossils, as
Upper Cretaceous. More recently, however, and partly
perhaps in consequence of the views maintained by the
writer since 1875, some change of opinion has occurred,
and Dr. Newberry and Mr. Lesquereux seem now inclined
to admit that what in Canada we recognise as
Upper Laramie is really Eocene, and the Lower Laramie
either Cretaceous or a transition group between this and
the Eocene. In a recent paper <a name="FNanchor_DV_126" id="FNanchor_DV_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_DV_126" class="fnanchor">[DV]</a> Dr. Newberry gives a
comparative table, in which he correlates the Lower
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">« 212 »</a></span>
Laramie with the Upper Cretaceous of Vancouver Island
and the Faxoe and Maestricht beds of Europe, while he
regards the Upper Laramie as equivalent to European
Eocene. Except in so far as the equivalence of the
Lower Laramie and Vancouver Island beds is concerned,
this corresponds very nearly with the conclusions of the
writer in a paper published last year<a name="FNanchor_DW_127" id="FNanchor_DW_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_DW_127" class="fnanchor">[DW]</a>&mdash;namely, that we
must either regard the Laramie as a transition Cretaceo-Eocene
group, or must institute our line of separation in
the Willow Creek or Middle Laramie division, which has,
however, as yet afforded no fossil plants. I doubt, however,
the equivalence of the Vancouver beds and the
Lower Laramie, except perhaps in so far as the upper
member of the former is concerned. I have also to observe
that in the latest report of Mr. Lesquereux he still
seems to retain in the Miocene certain formations in the
West, which from their fossil plants I should be inclined
to regard as Eocene.<a name="FNanchor_DX_128" id="FNanchor_DX_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_DX_128" class="fnanchor">[DX]</a></p>

valuable report of Mr. Lester F. Ward upon the Laramie of the United
States. I have merely had time to glance at this report, but can see that
the views of the author agree closely with those above expressed.</p></div>

<p>Two ferns occurring in these beds are remarkable as
evidence of the persistence of species, and of the peculiarities
of their ancient and modern distribution. <i>Onoclea
sensibilis</i>, the very common sensitive fern of eastern
America, is extremely abundant in the Laramie beds over
a great area in the West. Mr. Starkie Gardner and Dr.
Newberry have also shown that it is identical with the
<i>Filicites Hebridicus</i> of Forbes, from the early Eocene beds
of the Island of Mull, in Scotland. Thus we have a
species once common to Europe and America, but now
restricted to the latter, and which has continued to exist
over all the vast ages between the Cretaceous and the
present day. In the Laramie beds I have found associated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">« 213 »</a></span>
with this species another and more delicate fern,
the modern <i>Davallia</i> (<i>Stenloma</i>) <i>tenuifolia</i>, but this, unlike
its companion, no longer occurs in America, but is
found in the mountains of Asia. This is a curious illustration
of the fact that frail and delicate plants may be
more ancient than the mountains or plains on which
they live.</p>

<p>There are also some very interesting and curious facts
in connection with the conifers of the Laramie. One of
the most common of these is a <i>Thuja</i> or arbor vitæ (the
so-called &ldquo;cedar&rdquo; of Canada). The Laramie species has
been named <i>T. interrupta</i> by Newberry, but it approaches
very closely in its foliage to <i>T. occidentalis</i>, of eastern
Canada, while its fruit resembles that of the western
species, <i>T. gigantea</i>.</p>

<p>Still more remarkable are the Sequoias to which we
have already referred, but which in the Laramie age seem
to have been spread over nearly all North America. The
fossil species are of two types, representing respectively
the modern <i>S. gigantea</i> and <i>S. sempervirens</i>, and their
wood, as well as that of Thuja, is found in great abundance
in the lignites, and also in the form of silicified
trunks, and corresponds with that of the recent species.
The Laramie contains also conifers of the genera <i>Glyptostrobus</i>,
<i>Taxodium</i>, and <i>Taxus</i>; and the genus <i>Salisburia</i>
or gingko&mdash;so characteristic of the Jurassic and Cretaceous&mdash;is
still represented in America as well as in Europe
in the early Eocene.</p>

<p>We have no palms in the Canadian or Scottish Palæocene,
though I believe they are found further south. The
dicotyledonous trees are richly represented. Perhaps the
most conspicuous were three species of <i>Platanus</i>, the
leaves of which sometimes fill the sandstones, and one of
which, <i>P. nobilis</i>, Newberry, sometimes attains the gigantic
size of a foot or more in diameter of its blade.
The hazels are represented by a large-leaved species,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">« 214 »</a></span>
<i>C. Macquarrii</i>, and by leaves not distinguishable from those
of the modern American species, <i>C. Americana</i> and <i>C.
rostrata</i>. There are also chestnuts and oaks. But the
poplars and willows are specially abundant, being represented
by no less than six species, and it would seem
that all the modern types of poplar, as indicated by the
forms and venation of the leaves, existed already in the
Laramie, and most of them even in the Upper Cretaceous.
<i>Sassafras</i> is represented by two species, and the beautiful
group of <i>Viburnum</i>,, to which the modern tree-cranberry
belongs, has several fine species, of some of which both
leaves and berries have been found. The hickories and
butternuts are also present, the horse-chestnut, the <i>Catalpa</i>
and <i>Sapindus</i>, and some curious leaves which seem
to indicate the presence of the modern genus <i>Symphorocarpus</i>,
the snow-berry tribe.</p>

<p>The above may suffice to give an idea of the flora of
the older Eocene in North America, and I may refer for
details to the works of Newberry, Lesquereux, and Ward,
already cited. I must now add that the so-called Miocene
of Atanekerdluk, Greenland, is really of the same
age, as also the &ldquo;Miocene&rdquo; of Mull, in Scotland, of
Antrim, in Ireland, and of Bovey Tracey, in the south of
England, and the Gelinden, or &ldquo;Heersian&rdquo; beds, of Belgium,
described by Saporta. In comparing the American
specimens with the descriptions given by Gardner of the
leaf-beds at Ardtown, in Mull, we find, as already stated,
<i>Onoclea sensibilis</i>, common to both. The species of
<i>Sequoia</i>, <i>Gingko</i>, <i>Taxus</i>, and <i>Glyptostrobus</i> are also identical
or closely allied, and so are many of the dicotyledonous
leaves. For example, <i>Platanoides Hebridicus</i> is
very near to <i>P. nobilis</i>, and <i>Corylus Macquarrii</i> is common
to both formations, as well as <i>Populus Arctica</i> and
<i>P. Richardsoni</i>. I may add that ever since 1875-'76,
when I first studied the Laramie plants, I have maintained
their identity with those of the Fort Union group
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">« 215 »</a></span>
of the United States, and of the so-called Miocene of
McKenzie River and Greenland, and that the whole are
Paleocene; and this conclusion has now been confirmed
by the researches of Gardner in England, and by the discovery
of true Lower Miocene beds in the Canadian northwest,
overlying the Laramie or lignite series.</p>

<p>In a bulletin of the United States Geological Survey
(1886), Dr. White has established in the West the
continuous stratigraphical succession of the Laramie and
the Wahsatch Eocene, thus placing the Laramie conformably
below the Lower Eocene of that region. Cope
has also described as the Puerta group a series of beds
holding vertebrate fossils, and forming a transition from
the Laramie to the Wahsatch. White also testifies that a
number of fresh-water mollusks are common to the Wahsatch
and the Laramie. This finally settles the position
of the Laramie so far as the United States geologists are
concerned, and shows that the flora is to be regarded as
Eocene if not Upper Cretaceous, in harmony with what
has been all along maintained in Canada. An important
<i>résumé</i> of the flora has just been issued by Ward in the
bulletins of the United States Geological Survey (1887).</p>

<p>Before leaving this part of the subject, I would deprecate
the remark, which I see occasionally made, that fossil
plants are of little value in determining geological horizons
in the Cretaceous and Tertiary. I admit that in
these periods some allowance must be made for local
differences of station, and also that there is a generic
sameness in the flora of the northern hemisphere, from
the Cenomanian to the modern, yet these local differences
and general similarity are not of a nature to invalidate
inferences as to age. No doubt, so long as
palæobotanists seemed obliged, in deference to authority,
and to the results of investigations limited to a few European
localities, to group together, without distinction,
all the floras of the later Cretaceous and earlier Tertiary,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">« 216 »</a></span>
irrespective of stratigraphical considerations, the subject
lost its geological importance. But, when a good series
has been obtained in any one region of some extent, the
case becomes different. Though there is still much imperfection
in our knowledge of the Cretaceous and Tertiary
floras of Canada, I think the work already done is
sufficient to enable any competent observer to distinguish
by their fossil plants the Lower, Middle, and Upper Cretaceous,
and the latter from the Tertiary; and, with the
aid of the work already done by Lesquereux and Newberry
in the United States, to refer approximately to its
true geological position any group of plants from beds of
unknown age in the West.</p>

<p>An important consequence arising from the above
statements is that the period of warm climate which
enabled a temperate flora to exist in Greenland was that
of the later Cretaceous and early Eocene rather than, as
usually stated, the Miocene. It is also a question admitting
of discussion whether the Eocene flora of latitudes
so different as those of Greenland, Mackenzie River, northwest
Canada, and the United States, were strictly contemporaneous,
or successive within a long geological
period in which climatal changes were gradually proceeding.
The latter statement must apply at least to
the beginning and close of the period; but the plants
themselves have something to say in favour of contemporaneity.
The flora of the Laramie is not a tropical
but a temperate flora, showing no doubt that a much
more equable climate prevailed in the more northern
parts of America than at present. But this equability
of climate implies the possibility of a great geographical
range on the part of plants. Thus it is quite possible
and indeed highly probable that in the Laramie age a
somewhat uniform flora extended from the Arctic seas
through the great central plateau of America far to the
south, and in like manner along the western coast of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">« 217 »</a></span>
Europe. It is also to be observed that, as Gardner points
out, there are some differences indicating a diversity of
climate between Greenland and England, and even between
Scotland and Ireland and the south of England,
and we have similar differences, though not strongly-marked,
between the Laramie of northern Canada and
that of the United States. When all our beds of this
age from the Arctic sea to the 49th parallel have been
ransacked for plants, and when the palæobotanists of the
United States shall have succeeded in unravelling the
confusion which now exists between their Laramie and
the Middle Tertiary, the geologist of the future will be
able to restore with much certainty the distribution of
the vast forests which in the early Eocene covered the
now bare plains of interior America. Further, since the
break which in western Europe separates the flora of the
Cretaceous from that of the Eocene does not exist in
America, it will then be possible to trace the succession
from the Mesozoic flora of the Trias and of the Queen
Charlotte Islands and Kootanie series of the Lower Cretaceous
up to the close of the Eocene; and to determine,
for America at least, the manner and conditions
under which the angiospermous flora of the later Cretaceous
succeeded to the pines and cycads which characterised
the beginning of the Cretaceous period. In so
far as Europe is concerned, this may be more difficult,
since the want of continuity of land from north to south
seems there to have been fatal to the continuance of some
plants during changes of climate, and there were also
apparently in the Kainozoic period invasions at certain
times of species from the south and east, which did not
occur to the same extent in America.</p>

<p>In recent reports on the Tertiary floras of Australia
and New Zealand,<a name="FNanchor_DY_129" id="FNanchor_DY_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_DY_129" class="fnanchor">[DY]</a> Ettingshausen holds that the flora of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">« 218 »</a></span>
the Tertiary, as a whole, was of a generalised character;
forms now confined to the southern and northern hemispheres
respectively being then common to both. It
would thus seem that the present geographical diversities
must have largely arisen from the great changes in climate
and distribution of land and water in the later
Tertiary.</p>

<p>The length of our discussion of the early angiospermous
flora does not permit us to trace it in detail through
the Miocene and Pliocene, but we may notice the connection
through these in the next chapter, and may refer
to the magnificent publications of Heer and Lesquereux
on the Tertiary floras of Europe and America respectively.</p>

<p class="caption3">PLANTS FROM THE TERTIARY TO THE MODERN PERIOD.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> may be well to begin this chapter with a sketch of
the general physical and geological conditions of the period
which was characterised by the advent and culmination
of the dicotyledonous trees.</p>

<p>In the Jurassic and earliest Cretaceous periods the
prevalence, over the whole of the northern hemisphere
and for a long time, of a monotonous assemblage of gymnospermous
and acrogenous plants, implies a uniform
and mild climate, and facility for intercommunication in
the north. Toward the end of the Jurassic and beginning
of the Cretaceous, the land of the northern hemisphere was
assuming greater dimensions, and the climate probably
becoming a little less uniform. Before the close of the
Lower Cretaceous period the dicotyledonous flora seems
to have been introduced, under geographical conditions
which permitted a warm temperate climate to extend as
far north as Greenland.</p>

<p>In the Cenomanian or Middle Cretaceous age we find
the northern hemisphere tenanted with dicotyledonous
trees closely allied to those of modern times, though still
indicating a climate much warmer than that which at
present prevails. In this age, extensive but gradual submergence
of land is indicated by the prevalence of chalk
and marine limestones over the surface of both continents;
but a circumpolar belt seems to have been maintained,
protecting the Atlantic and Pacific basins from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">« 220 »</a></span>
floating ice, and permitting a temperate flora of great
richness to prevail far to the north, and especially along
the southern margins and extensions of the circumpolar
land. These seem to have been the physical conditions
which terminated the existence of the old Mesozoic flora
and introduced that of the Middle Cretaceous.</p>

<p>As time advanced the quantity of land gradually increased,
and the extension of new plains along the older
ridges of land was coincident with the deposition of the
great Laramie series, and with the origination of its peculiar
flora, which indicates a mild climate and considerable
variety of station in mountain, plain, and swamp,
as well as in great sheets of shallow and weedy fresh
water.</p>

<p>In the Eocene and Miocene periods, the continents
gradually assumed their present form, and the vegetation
became still more modern in aspect. In that period of
the Eocene, however, in which the great nummulitic
limestones were deposited, a submergence of land occurred
on the eastern continent which must have assimilated its
physical conditions to those of the Middle Cretaceous.
This great change, affecting materially the flora of Europe,
was not equally great in America, which also by the
north and south extension of its mountain-chains permitted
movements of migration not possible in the Old
World. From the Eocene downward, the remains of
land-animals and plants are found chiefly in lake-basins
occupying the existing depressions of the land, though
more extensive than those now remaining. It must also
be borne in mind that the great foldings and fractures of
the crust of the earth which occurred at the close of the
Eocene, and to which the final elevation of such ranges
as the Alps and the Rocky Mountains belongs, permanently
modified and moulded the forms of the continents.</p>

<p>These statements raise, however, questions as to the
precise equivalence in time of similar floras found in different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">« 221 »</a></span>
latitudes. However equable the climate, there
must have been some appreciable difference in proceeding
from north to south. If, therefore, as seems in
every way probable, the new species of plants originated
on the Arctic land and spread themselves southward,
this latter process would occur most naturally in
times of gradual refrigeration or of the access of a
more extreme climate&mdash;that is, in times of the elevation
of land in the temperate latitudes, or, conversely, of
local depression of land in the Arctic, leading to invasions
of northern ice. Hence, the times of the prevalence of
particular types of plants in the far north would precede
those of their extension to the south, and a flora found
fossil in Greenland might be supposed to be somewhat
older than a similar flora when found farther south. It
would seem, however, that the time required for the extension
of a new flora to its extreme geographical limit is
so small, in comparison with the duration of an entire
geological period, that, practically, this difference is of
little moment, or at least does not amount to antedating
the Arctic flora of a particular type by a whole period,
but only by a fraction of such period.</p>

<p>It does not appear that, during the whole of the Cretaceous
and Eocene periods, there is any evidence of such
refrigeration as seriously to interfere with the flora, but
perhaps the times of most considerable warmth are those
of the Dunvegan group in the Middle Cretaceous, and
those of the later Laramie and oldest Eocene.</p>

<p>It would appear that no cause for the mild temperature
of the Cretaceous needs to be invoked, other than
those mutations of land and water which the geological
deposits themselves indicate. A condition, for example,
of the Atlantic basin in which the high land of Greenland
should be reduced in elevation, and at the same time the
northern inlets of the Atlantic closed against the invasion
of Arctic ice, would at once restore climatic conditions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">« 222 »</a></span>
allowing of the growth of a temperate flora in Greenland.
As Dr. Brown has shown,<a name="FNanchor_DZ_130" id="FNanchor_DZ_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_DZ_130" class="fnanchor">[DZ]</a> and as I have elsewhere
argued, the absence of light in the Arctic winter is no
disadvantage, since, during the winter, the growth of
deciduous trees is in any case suspended; while the constant
continuance of light in the summer is, on the contrary,
a very great stimulus and advantage.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_DZ_130" id="Footnote_DZ_130"></a><a href="#FNanchor_DZ_130"><span class="label">[DZ]</span></a> &ldquo;Florula Discoana.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>It is a remarkable phenomenon in the history of genera
of plants in the later Mesozoic and Tertiary, that the
older genera appear at once in a great number of specific
types, which become reduced as well as limited in range
down to the modern. This is, no doubt, connected with
the greater differentiation of local conditions in the modern;
but it indicates also a law of rapid multiplication of
species in the early life of genera. The distribution of the
species of <i>Salisburia</i>, <i>Sequoia</i>, <i>Platanus</i>, <i>Sassafras</i>, <i>Liriodendron</i>,
<i>Magnolia</i>, and many other genera, affords remarkable
proofs of this.</p>

<p>Gray, Saporta, Heer, Newberry, Lesquereux, and
Starkie Gardner have all ably discussed these points; but
the continual increase of our knowledge of the several
floras, and the removal of error as to the dates of their
appearance, must greatly conduce to clearer and more
definite ideas. In particular, the prevailing opinion that
the Miocene was the period of the greatest extension of
warmth and of a temperate flora into the Arctic, must
be abandoned in favour of the later Cretaceous and
Eocene; and, if I mistake not, this will be found to accord
better with the evidence of general geology and of
animal fossils.</p>

<p>In these various revolutions of the later Cretaceous
and Kainozoic periods, America, as Dr. Gray has well
pointed out, has had the advantage of a continuous stretch
of high land from north to south, affording a more sure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">« 223 »</a></span>
refuge to plants in times of submergence, and means of
escape to the south in times of refrigeration. Hence,
the greater continuity of American vegetation and the
survival of genera like <i>Sequoia</i> and <i>Liriodendron</i>, which
have perished in the Old World. Still, there are some exceptions
to this, for the gingko-tree is a case of survival in
Asia of a type once plentiful in America, but now extinct
there. Eastern Asia has had, however, some considerable
share of the same advantage possessed by America, with
the addition, referred to by Gray, of a better and more
insular climate.</p>

<p>But our survey of these physical conditions can not be
considered complete till we shall have considered the
great Glacial age of the Pleistocene. It is certain that
throughout the later Miocene and Pliocene the area of land
in the northern hemisphere was increasing, and the large
and varied continents were tenanted by the noblest vegetation
and the grandest forms of mammalian life that the
earth has ever witnessed. As the Pliocene drew to a
close, a gradual diminution of warmth came on, and
more especially a less equable climate, and this was accompanied
with a subsidence of the land in the temperate
regions and with changes of the warm ocean-currents.
Thus gradually the summers became cooler and the
winters longer and more severe, the hill-tops became
covered with permanent snows, glaciers ploughed their
way downward into the plains, and masses and fields of
floating ice cooled the seas. In these circumstances the
richer and more delicate forms of vegetation must have
been chilled to death or obliged to remove farther south,
and in many extensive regions, hemmed in by the advance
of the sea on the one hand and land-ice on the other, they
must have altogether perished.</p>

<p>Yet even in this time vegetation was not altogether
extinct. Along the Gulf of Mexico in America, and in
the Mediterranean basin in Europe, there were still some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">« 224 »</a></span>
remains of a moderate climate and certain boreal and
arctic forms moving southward continued to exist here
and there in somewhat high latitudes, just as similar
plants now thrive in Grinnell Land within sight of the
snows of the Greenland mountains. A remarkable summary
of some of these facts as they relate to England was
given by an eminent English botanist, Mr. Carruthers, in
his address as President of the Biological Section of the
British Association at Birmingham in 1886. At Cromer,
on the coast of Norfolk, the celebrated forest-bed of newer
Pliocene age, and containing the remains of a copious
mammalian fauna, holds also remains of plants in a state
admitting of determination. These have been collected
by Mr. Reid, of the Geological Survey, and were reported
on by Carruthers, who states that they represent a somewhat
colder temperature than that of the present day. I
quote the following details from the address.</p>

<p>With reference to the plants of the forest-bed or
newer Pliocene he remarks as follows:</p>

<p>"Only one species (<i>Trapa natans</i>, Willd.) has disappeared
from our islands. Its fruits, which Mr. Reid
found abundantly in one locality, agree with those of the
plants found until recently in the lakes of Sweden. Four
species (<i>Prunus speciosa</i>, L., <i>&OElig;nanthe Tichenalii</i>, Sm.,
<i>Potamogeton pterophyllus</i>, Sch., and <i>Pinus abies</i>, L.)
are found at present only in Europe, and a fifth (<i>Potamogeton
trichoides</i>, Cham.) extends also to North America;
two species (<i>Peucedanum palustre</i>, Moench, and
<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>, L.) are found also in Siberia, while six
more (<i>Sanguisorba officinalis</i>, L., <i>Rubus fruticosus</i>, L., 5
<i>Cornus sanguinea</i>, L., <i>Euphorbia amygdaloides</i>, L.,
<i>Quercus robur</i>, L., and <i>Potamogeton crispus</i>, L.) extend
into western Asia, and two (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, L., and
<i>Alnus glutinosa</i>, L.) are included in the Japanese flora.
Seven species, while found with the others, enter also into
the Mediterranean flora, extending to North Africa: these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">« 225 »</a></span>
are <i>Thalictrum minus</i>, L., <i>Thalictrum flavum</i>, L., <i>Ranunculus
repens</i>, L., <i>Stellaria aquatica</i>, Scop., <i>Corylus
avellana</i>, L., <i>Yannichellia palustris</i>, L., and <i>Cladium
mariscus</i>, Br. With a similar distribution in the Old
World, eight species (<i>Bidens tripartita</i>, L., <i>Myosotis
cæspitosa</i>, Schultz, <i>Suæda maritima</i>, Dum., <i>Ceratophyllum
demersum</i>,, L., <i>Sparganium ramosum</i>, Huds., <i>Potamogeton
pectinatus</i>, L., <i>Carex paludosa</i>, Good., and <i>Osmunda
regalis</i>, L.) are found also in North America. Of
the remainder, ten species (<i>Nuphar luteum</i>, Sm., <i>Menyanthes
trifoliata</i>, L., <i>Stachys palustris</i>, L., <i>Rumex maritimus</i>,
L., <i>Rumex acetosella</i>, L., <i>Betula alba</i>, L., <i>Scirpus
pauciflorus</i>, Lightf., <i>Taxus baccata</i>, L., and <i>Isoetes lacustris</i>,
L.) extend round the north temperate zone, while
three (<i>Lycopus europæus</i>, L., <i>Alisma plantago</i>, L., and
<i>Phragmites communis</i>, Trim), having the same distribution
in the north, are found also in Australia, and one
(<i>Hippuris vulgaris</i>, L.) in the south of South America.
The list is completed by <i>Ranunculus aquatilis</i>, L., distributed
over all the temperate regions of the globe, and
<i>Scirpus lacustris</i>, L., which is found in many tropical
regions as well."</p>

<p>He remarks that these plants, while including species
now very widely scattered, present no appreciable change
of characters.</p>

<p>Above this bed are glacial clays, which hold other
species indicating an extremely cold climate. They are
few in number, only <i>Salix polaris</i>, a thoroughly arctic
species, and its ally, <i>S. cinerea</i>, L., and a moss, <i>Hypnum
turgescens</i>, Schimp., no longer found in Britain, but an
Alpine and arctic species. This bed belongs to the beginning
of the Glacial period, the deposits of which have as
yet afforded no plants in England. But plants occur in
post-glacial and upper-glacial beds in different parts of
England, to which Carruthers thus refers:</p>

<p>"The period of great cold, during which arctic ice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">« 226 »</a></span>
extended far into temperate regions, was not favorable to
vegetable life. But in some localities we have stratified
clays with plant-remains later than the Glacial epoch,
yet indicating that the great cold had not then entirely
disappeared. In the lacustrine beds at Holderness is
found a small birch (<i>Betula nana</i>, L.), now limited in
Great Britain to some of the mountains of Scotland, but
found in the arctic regions of the Old and New World
and on Alpine districts in Europe, and with it <i>Prunus
padus</i>, L., <i>Quercus robur</i>, L., <i>Corylus avellana</i>, L.,
<i>Alnus glutinosa</i>, L., and <i>Pinus sylvestris</i>, L. In the
white clay-beds at Bovey Tracey of the same age there
occur the leaves of <i>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi</i>, L., three
species of willow, viz., <i>Salix cinerea</i>, L., <i>S. myrtilloides</i>,
L., and <i>S. polaris</i>, Wahl., and in addition to our Alpine
<i>Betula nana</i>, L., the more familiar <i>B. alba</i>, L. Two of
these plants have been lost to our flora from the change
of climate that has taken place, viz., <i>Salix myrtilloides</i>,
L., and <i>S. polaris</i>, Wahl.; and <i>Betula nana</i>, L., has retreated
to the mountains of Scotland. Three others
(<i>Dryas octopetala</i>, L., <i>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi</i>, L., and
<i>Salix herbacea</i>, L.) have withdrawn to the mountains of
northern England, Wales, and Scotland, while the remainder
are still found scattered over the country. Notwithstanding
the diverse physical conditions to which
these plants have been subjected, the remains preserved
in these beds present no characters by which they can
be distinguished from the living representatives of the
species."</p>

<p>One of the instances referred to is very striking. At
Bovey Tracey the arctic beds rest directly on those holding
the rich, warm temperate flora of the Eocene; so
that here we have the evidence of fossil plants to show the
change from the climate of the Eocene to that of arctic
lands, and the modern vegetation to indicate the return
of a warm temperature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">« 227 »</a></span></p>

<p>In Canada, in the Pleistocene beds known as the Leda
clays, intervening between the lower boulder clay and
the Saxicava sand, which also holds boulders, there are
beds holding fossil plants, in some places intermixed with
sea-shells and bones of marine fishes, showing that they
were drifted into the sea at a time of submergence.
These remains are boreal rather than arctic in character,
and with the remains of drift-wood often found in the
boulder deposits serve to indicate that there were at all
times oases of hardy life in the glacial deserts, just as we
find these in polar lands at the present day. I condense
from a paper on these plants<a name="FNanchor_EA_131" id="FNanchor_EA_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_EA_131" class="fnanchor">[EA]</a> the following facts, with a
few additional notes:</p>

<p>The importance of all information bearing on the
temperature of the Post-pliocene period invests with
much interest the study of the land-plants preserved in
deposits of this age. Unfortunately, these are few in number,
and often not well preserved. In Canada, though
fragments of the woody parts of plants occasionally occur
in the marine clays and sands, there is only one locality
which has afforded any considerable quantity of remains
of their more perishable parts. This is the well-known
deposit of Leda clay at Green&rsquo;s Creek, on the Ottawa,
celebrated for the perfection in which the skeletons of
the capelin and other fishes are preserved in the calcareous
nodules imbedded in the clay. In similar nodules, contained
apparently in a layer somewhat lower than that
holding the ichthyolites, remains of land-plants are somewhat
abundant, and, from their association with shells of
<i>Leda glacialis</i>, seem to have been washed down from the
land into deep water. The circumstances would seem to
have been not dissimilar from those at present existing
in the northeast arm of Gaspé Basin, where I have dredged
from mud now being deposited in deep water, living
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">« 228 »</a></span>
specimens of <i>Leda limatula</i>, mixed with remains of land-plants.</p>

<p>The following are the species of plants recognised in
these nodules:</p>

<p>1. <i>Drosera rotundifolia</i>, Linn. In a calcareous nodule
from Green&rsquo;s Creek, the leaf only preserved. This plant
is common in bogs in Canada, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland,
and thence, according to Hooker, to the Arctic
circle. It is also European.</p>

<p>2. <i>Acer spicatum</i>, Lamx. (<i>Acer montanum</i>, Aiton.)
Leaf in a nodule from Green&rsquo;s Creek. Found in Nova
Scotia and Canada, also at Lake Winnipeg, according to
Richardson.</p>

<p>3. <i>Potentilla Canadensis</i>, Linn. In nodules from
Green&rsquo;s Creek; leaves only preserved. I have had some
difficulty in determining these,
but believe they must be referred
to the species above named, or
to <i>P. simplex</i>, Michx., supposed
by Hooker and Gray to be a variety.
It occurs in Canada and
New England, but I have no information
as to its range northward.</p>

<p>4. <i>Gaylussaccia resinosa</i>, Torrey
and Gray. Leaf in nodule
at Green&rsquo;s Creek. Abundant in
New England and in Canada,
also on Lake Huron and the Saskatchewan, according to
Richardson (<a href="#fig77">Fig. 77</a>).</p>

<p>5. <i>Populus balsamifera</i>, Linn. Leaves and branches
in nodules at Green&rsquo;s Creek. This is by much the most
common species, and its leaves are of small size, as if from
trees growing in cold and exposed situations. The species
is North American and Asiatic, and abounds in New England
and Canada. It extends to the Arctic circle, and is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">« 229 »</a></span>
abundant on the shores of the Great Slave Lake and on
the McKenzie River, and according to Richardson constitutes
much of the drift timber of the Arctic coast
(<a href="#fig78">Fig. 78</a>).</p>

<p>6. <i>Thuja occidentalism</i> Linn. Trunks and branches
in the Leda clay at Montreal. This tree occurs in New
England and Canada, and extends northward into the
Hudson Bay territories. It is a northern though not
arctic species in its geographical range. According to
Lyell it occurs associated with the bones of Mastodon in
New Jersey. From the great durability of its wood, it is
one of the trees most likely to be preserved in aqueous
deposits.</p>

<p>7. <i>Potamogeton perfoliatus</i>, Linn. Leaves and seeds
in nodules at Green&rsquo;s Creek. Inhabits streams of the
Northern States and Canada, and according to Richardson
extends to Great Slave Lake.</p>

<p>8. <i>Potamogeton pusillus.</i> Quantities of fragments
which I refer to this species occur in nodules at Green&rsquo;s
Creek. They may possibly belong to a variety of <i>P.
hybridus</i> which, together with <i>P. natans</i>, now grows in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">« 230 »</a></span>
the river Ottawa, where it flows over the beds containing
these fossils.</p>

<p>9. <i>Cariceæ and Gramineæ.</i> Fragments in nodules
from Green&rsquo;s Creek appear to belong to plants of these
groups, but I cannot venture to determine their species.</p>

<p>10. <i>Equisetum scirpoides</i>, Michx. Fragments in nodules,
Green&rsquo;s Creek. This is a widely distributed species,
occurring in the Northern States and Canada.</p>

<p>11. <i>Fontinalis.</i> In nodules at Green&rsquo;s Creek there
occur, somewhat plentifully, branches of a moss apparently
of the genus <i>Fontinalis</i>.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 243px;">

<p>12. <i>Algæ.</i> With the
plants above mentioned,
both at Green&rsquo;s Creek
and at Montreal, there
occur remains of sea-weeds
(<a href="#fig79">Fig. 79</a>). They
seem to belong to the
genera <i>Fucus</i> and <i>Ulva</i>,
but I cannot determine
the species. A thick
stem in one of the nodules
would seem to indicate
a large <i>Laminaria</i>.
With the above there are
found at Green&rsquo;s Creek a
number of fragments of leaves, stems, and fruits, which
I have not been able to refer to their species, principally
on account of their defective state of preservation.</p>

<p>None of the plants above mentioned is properly arctic
in its distribution, and the assemblage may be characterised
as a selection from the present Canadian flora of some
of the more hardy species having the most northern
range. Green&rsquo;s Creek is in the central part of Canada,
near to the parallel of 46°, and an accidental selection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">« 231 »</a></span>
from its present flora, though it might contain the same
species found in the nodules, would certainly include with
these, or instead of some of them, more southern forms.
More especially the balsam poplar, though that tree occurs
plentifully on the Ottawa, would not be so predominant.
But such an assemblage of drift-plants might
be furnished by any American stream flowing in the latitude
of 50° to 55° north. If a stream flowing to the
north, it might deposit these plants in still more northern
latitudes, as the McKenzie River does now. If flowing
to the south, it might deposit them to the south of 50°.
In the case of the Ottawa, the plants could not have been
derived from a more southern locality, nor probably from
one very far to the north. We may therefore safely assume
that the refrigeration indicated by these plants
would place the region bordering the Ottawa in nearly the
same position with that of the south coast of Labrador
fronting on the Gulf of St. Lawrence at present. The
absence of all the more arctic species occurring in Labrador
should perhaps induce us to infer a somewhat
milder climate than this.</p>

<p>The moderate amount of refrigeration thus required
would in my opinion accord very well with the probable
conditions of climate deducible from the circumstances in
which the fossil plants in question occur. At the time
when they were deposited the sea flowed up the Ottawa
valley to a height of 200 to 400 feet above its present
level, and the valley of the St. Lawrence was a wide arm
of the sea, open to the arctic current. Under these conditions
the immense quantities of drift-ice from the
northward, and the removal of the great heating surface
now presented by the low lands of Canada and New England,
must have given for the Ottawa coast of that period
a summer temperature very similar to that at present experienced
on the Labrador coast, and with this conclusion
the marine remains of the Leda clay, as well as the few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">« 232 »</a></span>
land molluscs whose shells have been found in the beds
containing the plants, and which are species still occurring
in Canada, perfectly coincide.</p>

<p>The climate of that portion of Canada above water at
the time when these plants were imbedded may safely be
assumed to have been colder in summer than at present,
to an extent equal to about 5° of latitude, and this refrigeration
may be assumed to correspond with the requirements
of the actual geographical changes implied.
In other words, if Canada was submerged until the
Ottawa valley was converted into an estuary inhabited by
species of <i>Leda</i>, and frequented by capelin, the diminution
of the summer heat consequent on such depression
would be precisely suitable to the plants occurring in
these deposits, without assuming any other cause of
change of climate.</p>

<p>I have arranged elsewhere the Post-pliocene deposits
of the central part of Canada, as consisting of, in ascending
order: (1) The boulder clay; (2) a deep-water deposit,
the Leda clay; and (3) a shallow-water deposit, the
Saxicava sand. But, although I have placed the boulder
clay in the lowest position, it must be observed that I do
not regard this as a continuous layer of equal age in all
places. On the contrary, though locally, as at Montreal,
under the Leda clay, it is in other places and at other
levels contemporaneous with or newer than that deposit,
which itself also locally contains boulders.</p>

<p>At Green&rsquo;s Creek the plant-bearing nodules occur in
the lower part of the Leda clay, which contains a few
boulders, and is apparently in places overlaid by large
boulders, while no distinct boulder clay underlies it.
The circumstances which accumulated the thick bed of
boulder clay near Montreal were probably absent in the
Ottawa valley. In any case we must regard the deposits
of Green&rsquo;s Creek as coeval with the Leda clay of Montreal,
and with the period of the greatest abundance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">« 233 »</a></span>
<i>Leda glacialis</i>, the most exclusively arctic shell of these deposits.
In other words, I regard the plants above mentioned
as probably belonging to the period of greatest refrigeration
of which we have any evidence, of course not
including that mythical period of universal incasement in
ice, of which, as I have elsewhere endeavoured to show,
in so far as Canada is concerned, there is no evidence
whatever.<a name="FNanchor_EB_132" id="FNanchor_EB_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_EB_132" class="fnanchor">[EB]</a></p>

<p>The facts above stated in reference to Post-pliocene
plants concur, with all the other evidence I have been
able to obtain, in the conclusion that the refrigeration of
Canada in the Post-pliocene period consisted of a diminution
of the summer heat, and was of no greater amount
than that fairly attributable to the great depression of the
land and the different distribution of the ice-bearing
arctic current.</p>

<p>In connection with the plants above noticed, it is interesting
to observe that at Green&rsquo;s Creek, at Pakenham
Mills, at Montreal, and at Clarenceville on Lake Champlain,
species of Canadian <i>Pulmonata</i> have been found in
deposits of the same age with those containing the plants.
The species which have been noticed belong to the genera
<i>Lymnea</i> and <i>Planorbis</i>.</p>

<p>The Glacial age was, fortunately, not of very long duration,
though its length has been much exaggerated by
certain schools of geologists,<a name="FNanchor_EC_133" id="FNanchor_EC_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_EC_133" class="fnanchor">[EC]</a> It passed away, and a returning
cosmic spring gladdened the earth, and was ushered
in by a time of great rainfall and consequent denudation
and deposit, which has been styled the &ldquo;Pluvial
Period&rdquo; The remains of the Pliocene forests then returned&mdash;with
somewhat diminished numbers of species&mdash;from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">« 234 »</a></span>
the south and again occupied the land, though they
have not been able, in their decimated condition, to restore
the exuberance of the flora of the earlier Tertiary.
In point of fact, as we shall see in the next chapter, it is
the floras originating within the polar circle and coming
down from the north that are rich and copious. Those
that, after periods of cold or submergence, return from
the south, are comparatively poor. Hence the modern
flora is far inferior to that of the Middle Kainozoic. In
America, however, and in eastern Asia, for reasons already
stated, the return was more abundant than in
Europe.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_EC_133" id="Footnote_EC_133"></a><a href="#FNanchor_EC_133"><span class="label">[EC]</span></a> This I have long maintained on grounds connected with Pleistocene
fossils, amount of denudation and deposit, &amp;c., and I am glad to see that
Prestwich, the best English authority on such subjects, has recently announced
similar conclusions, based on independent reasons.</p></div>

<p>Simultaneously with the return of the old temperate
flora, the arctic plants that had overspread the land retreated
to mountain-tops, now bared of ice and snow, and
back to the polar lands whence they came; and so it happens
that, on the White Mountains, the Alps, and the
Himalayas, we have insular patches of the same groups of
plants that exist around the pole.</p>

<p>These changes need not have required a very long
time, for the multiplication and migration of plants are
very rapid, especially when aided by the agency of migratory
animals. Many parts of the land must, indeed, have
been stocked with plants from various sources, and by
agencies&mdash;as that of the sea&mdash;which might at first sight
seem adverse to their distribution. The British Islands,
for example, have no indigenous plants. Their flora
consists mainly of Germanic plants, which must have
migrated to Britain in that very late period of the Post-glacial
when the space now occupied by the North Sea
was mostly dry land. Other portions of it are Scandinavian
plants, perhaps survivors of the Glacial age, or
carried by migratory birds; and still another element
consists of Spanish plants, brought north by spring migrants,
and establishing themselves in warm and sheltered
spots, just as the arctic plants do on the bleak hill-tops.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">« 235 »</a></span>
The Bermudas, altogether recent islands, have one hundred
and fifty species of native plants, all of which are
West Indian and American, and must have been introduced
by the sea-currents or by migratory birds.</p>

<p>And so the earth became fitted for the residence of
modern man. Yet it is not so good or Edenic a world as
it once was, or as it may yet become, were another revolution
to restore a mild climate to the arctic regions, and
to send down a new swarm of migratory species to renew
the face of the earth and restore it to its pristine fertility
of vegetable life.</p>

<p>Thus closes this long history of the succession of
plants, reaching from the far back Laurentian to the
present day. It has, no doubt, many breaks, and much
remains to be discovered. Yet it may lead us to some
positive conclusions regarding the laws of the introduction
of plants.</p>

<p>One of these, and perhaps the most remarkable of all,
is that certain principles were settled very far back, and
have remained ever since. We have seen that in the
earliest geological periods all that pertains to the structure,
powers, and laws of the vegetable cell was already
fixed and settled. When we consider how much this
implies of mechanical structure and chemical and vital
property, the profound significance of this statement becomes
apparent. The relations in these respects between
the living cell and the soil, the atmosphere and the sunshine,
were apparently as perfect in the early Palæozoic
as in any subsequent time. The same may be said of the
structures of the leaf and of the stem. In such old forms
as Nematophyton these were, it is true, peculiar and rudimentary,
but in the Devonian and Carboniferous the
structure of leaves and stems embodied all the parts and
principles that we find at present. In regard to fructification
there has been more progress, for, so far as we
know, the highest and most complex forms of flowery,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">« 236 »</a></span>
fruits, and seeds belong to the more recent periods, and
simpler forms were at least dominant in the older times.
Yet even in this respect the great leading laws and structures
of bisexual reproduction were perfected in the early
Palæozoic, and the improvements introduced in the gymnosperm
and the angiosperm of later periods have consisted
mainly in additions of accessory parts, and in modifications
and refinements suited to the wants of the higher
and more complex types.</p>

difficulties, yet is fertile of the most interesting theoretical

<p>The earliest suggestion on the subject known to the
writer is that of Prof. Asa Gray, in 1867, with reference
to the probable northern source of the related floras of
North America and eastern Asia. With the aid of the
new facts disclosed by Heer and Lesquereux, Gray returned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">« 238 »</a></span>
to the subject in 1872, and more fully developed
this conclusion with reference to the Tertiary floras,<a name="FNanchor_EE_135" id="FNanchor_EE_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_EE_135" class="fnanchor">[EE]</a>

<p>&ldquo;I can only say, at large, that the same species (of
Tertiary fossil plants) have been found all round the
world; that the richest and most extensive finds are in
Greenland; that they comprise most of the sorts which I
have spoken of, as American trees which once lived in
Europe&mdash;magnolias, sassafras, hickories, gum-trees, our
identical southern cypress (for all we can see of difference),
and especially <i>Sequoias</i>, not only the two which
obviously answer to the two big-trees now peculiar to
California, but several others; that they equally comprise
trees now peculiar to Japan and China, three kinds
of gingko-trees, for instance, one of them not evidently
distinguishable from the Japan species which alone survives;
that we have evidence, not merely of pines and
maples, poplars, birches, lindens, and whatever else characterise
the temperate zone forests of our era, but also of
particular species of these, so like those of our own time
and country that we may fairly reckon them as the ancestors
of several of ours. Long genealogies always deal
more or less in conjecture; but we appear to be within
the limits of scientific inference when we announce that
our existing temperate trees came from the north, and
within the bounds of nigh probability when we claim not
a few of them as the originals of present species. Remains
of the same plants have been found fossil in our temperate
region as well as in Europe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Between 1860 and 1870 the writer was engaged in
working out all that could be learned of the Devonian
plants of eastern America, the oldest known flora of any
richness, and which consists almost exclusively of gigantic,
and to us grotesque, representatives of the club-mosses,
ferns, and mares'-tails, with some trees allied to the cycads
and pines. In this pursuit nearly all the more important
localities were visited, and access was had to the large
collections of Prof. Hall and Prof. Newberry, in New
York and Ohio, and to those made in the remarkable
plant-bearing beds of New Brunswick by Messrs. Matthew
and Hartt. In the progress of these researches, which
developed an unexpectedly rich assemblage of species, the
northern origin of this old flora seemed to be established
by its earlier culmination in the northeast, in connection
with the growth of the American land to the southward,
which took place after the great Upper Silurian subsidence,
by elevations beginning in the north while those
portions of the continent to the southwest still remained
under the sea. The same result was indicated by the
persistence in the Carboniferous of the south and west of
old Erian forms, like <i>Megalopteris</i>.</p>

<p>When, in 1870, the labours of those ten years were
brought before the Royal Society of London, in the
Bakerian lecture of that year, and in a memoir illustrating
no less than one hundred and twenty-five species of
plants older than the great Carboniferous system, these
deductions were stated in connection with the conclusions
of Hall, Logan, and Dana, as to the distribution of sediment
along the northeast side of the American continent,
and the anticipation was hazarded that the oldest Palæozoic
floras would be discovered to the north of Newfoundland.
Mention was also made of the apparent earlier
and more copious birth of the Devonian flora in America
than in Europe, a fact which is itself connected with the
greater northward extension of this continent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">« 240 »</a></span></p>

<p>The memoir containing these results was not published
by the Royal Society, but its publication was secured in a
less complete form in the reports of the &ldquo;Geological Survey
of Canada.&rdquo; The part of the memoir relating to Canadian
fossil plants, with a portion of the theoretical deductions,
was published in a report issued in 1871.<a name="FNanchor_EG_137" id="FNanchor_EG_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_EG_137" class="fnanchor">[EG]</a> In this
report the following language was used:</p>

Canada,&rdquo; pp. 92, twenty plates, Montreal, 1871.</p></div>

<p>"In eastern America, from the Carboniferous period
onward, the centre of plant distribution has been the Appalachian
chain. From this the plants and sediments
extended westward in times of elevation, and to this they
receded in times of depression. But this centre was nonexistent
before the Devonian period, and the centre for
this must have been to the northeast, whence the great
mass of older Appalachian sediment was derived. In the
Carboniferous period there was also an eastward distribution
from the Appalachians, and links of connection in
the Atlantic bed between the floras of Europe and America.
In the Devonian such connection can have been only
far to the northeast. It is therefore in Newfoundland,
Labrador, and Greenland that we are to look for the
oldest American flora, and in like manner on the border
of the old Scandinavian nucleus for that of Europe.</p>

<p>"Again, it must have been the wide extension of the
sea of the corniferous limestone that gave the last blow
to the remaining flora of the Lower Devonian; and the
re-elevation in the middle of that epoch brought in the
Appalachian ridges as a new centre, and established a
connection with Europe which introduced the Upper
Devonian and Carboniferous floras. Lastly, from the
comparative richness of the later Erian<a name="FNanchor_EH_138" id="FNanchor_EH_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_EH_138" class="fnanchor">[EH]</a> flora in eastern
America, especially in the St. John beds, it might be a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">« 241 »</a></span>
fair inference that the northeastern end of the Appalachian
ridge was the original birthplace or centre of creation
of what we may call the later Palæozoic flora, or of
a large part of that flora."</p>

<p>When my paper was written I had not seen the account
published by the able Swiss palæobotanist Heer, of
the remarkable Devonian flora of Bear Island, near Spitzbergen.<a name="FNanchor_EI_139" id="FNanchor_EI_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_EI_139" class="fnanchor">[EI]</a>
From want of acquaintance with the older
floras of America and western Europe, Heer fell into the
unfortunate error of regarding the whole of Bear Island
plants as Lower Carboniferous, a mistake which his great
authority has tended to perpetuate, and which has even
led to the still graver error of some European geologists,
who do not hesitate to regard as Carboniferous the fossil
plants of the American deposits from the Hamilton to
the Chemung groups inclusive, though these belong to
formations underlying the oldest Carboniferous, and characterised
by animal remains of unquestioned Devonian
age. In 1872 I addressed a note to the Geological Society
of London on the subject of the so-called &ldquo;Ursa stage&rdquo;
of Heer, showing that, though it contained some forms
not known at so early a date in temperate Europe, it was
clearly, in part at least, Devonian when tested by North
American standards; but that in this high latitude, in
which, for reasons stated in the report above referred to,
I believed the Devonian plants to have originated, there
might be an intermixture of the two floras. But such a
mixed group should in that latitude be referred to a
lower horizon than if found in temperate regions. Dr.
Nathorst, as already stated, has recently obtained new
facts which go to show that plants of two distinct horizons
may have been intermixed in the collections submitted
to Heer.</p>

<p>Between 1870 and 1873 my attention was turned to
the two sub-floras intermediate between those of the Devonian
and the coal-formation, the floras of the Lower
Carboniferous (Subcarboniferous of some American geologists)
and the Millstone Grit, and in a report upon
these<a name="FNanchor_EJ_140" id="FNanchor_EJ_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_EJ_140" class="fnanchor">[EJ]</a> similar deductions were expressed. It was stated
that in Newfoundland the coal-beds seem to belong to
the Millstone Grit series, and as we proceed southward
they belong to progressively newer portions of the Carboniferous
system. The same fact is observed in the
coal-beds of Scotland, as compared with those of England,
and it indicates that the coal-formation flora, like
that of the Devonian, spread itself from the north, and
this accords with the somewhat extensive occurrence of
Lower Carboniferous rocks and fossils in the Parry Islands
and elsewhere in the arctic regions.</p>

<p>Passing over the comparatively poor flora of the earlier
Mesozoic, consisting largely of cycads, pines, and ferns,
and as yet little known in the arctic, and which may
have originated in the south, though represented, according
to Heer, by the supposed Jurassic flora of Siberia, we
find, especially at Komé and Atané in Greenland, an interesting
occurrence of those earliest precursors of the
truly modern forms of plants which appear in the Cretaceous,
the period of the English chalk and of the New
Jersey greensands. There are two plant-groups of this
age in Greenland; one, that of Komé, consists almost entirely
of ferns, cycads, and pines, and is of decidedly
Mesozoic aspect. This is called Lower Cretaceous. The
other, that of Atané, holds remains of many modern temperate
genera, as <i>Populus</i>, <i>Myrica</i>, <i>Ficus</i>, <i>Sassafras</i>, and
<i>Magnolia</i>. This is regarded as Upper Cretaceous. Resting
upon these Upper Cretaceous beds, without the intervention
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">« 243 »</a></span>
of any other formation,<a name="FNanchor_EK_141" id="FNanchor_EK_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_EK_141" class="fnanchor">[EK]</a> are beds rich in plants
of much more modern appearance, and referred by Heer
to the Miocene period, a reference, as we have seen, not
warranted by comparison with the Tertiary plants of Europe
or of America. Still farther north this so-called
Miocene assemblage of plants appears in Spitzbergen and
Grinnell Land; but there, owing to the predominance of
trees allied to the spruces, it has a decidedly more boreal
character than in Greenland, as might be anticipated from
its nearer approach to the pole.<a name="FNanchor_EL_142" id="FNanchor_EL_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_EL_142" class="fnanchor">[EL]</a></p>

<p>If now we turn to the Cretaceous and Tertiary floras
of western America, as described by Lesquereux, Newberry,
and others, we find in the lowest Cretaceous rocks
there known&mdash;those of the Dakota group&mdash;which may be
in the lower part of the Middle Cretaceous, a series of
plants<a name="FNanchor_EM_143" id="FNanchor_EM_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_EM_143" class="fnanchor">[EM]</a> essentially similar to those of the so-called Upper
Cretaceous of Greenland. They occur in beds indicating
land and fresh-water conditions as prevalent at the time
over great areas of the interior of America. But overlying
this plant-bearing formation we have an oceanic
limestone (the Niobrara), corresponding in many respects
to the European chalk, and extending far north into the
British territory,<a name="FNanchor_EN_144" id="FNanchor_EN_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_EN_144" class="fnanchor">[EN]</a> indicating that the land of the Lower
Cretaceous was replaced by a vast Mediterranean Sea,
filled with warm water from the equatorial currents, and
not invaded by cold waters from the north. This is succeeded
by thick Upper Cretaceous deposits of clay and
sandstone, with marine remains, though very sparsely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">« 244 »</a></span>
distributed; and these show that further subsidence or
denudation in the north had opened a way for the arctic
currents, killing out the warm-water animals of the Niobrara
group, and rilling up the Mediterranean of that
period. Of the flora of these Upper Cretaceous periods,
which must have been very long, we know something in
the interior regions, from the discovery of a somewhat
rich flora in the Dunvegan beds of the Peace River district,
on the northern shore of the great Cretaceous Mediterranean;<a name="FNanchor_EO_145" id="FNanchor_EO_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_EO_145" class="fnanchor">[EO]</a>
and on the coast of British Columbia we
have the remarkable Cretaceous coal-field of Vancouver
Island, which holds the remains of plants of modern
genera, and, indeed, of almost as modern aspect as those
of the so-called Miocene of Greenland. They indicate,
however, a warmer climate as then prevalent on the Pacific
coast, and in this respect correspond with a peculiar
transition flora, intermediate between the Cretaceous and
Eocene or earliest Tertiary of the interior regions, and
which is described by Lesquereux as the Lower Lignitic.</p>

<p>Immediately above these Upper Cretaceous beds we
have the great Lignite Tertiary of the West&mdash;the Laramie
group of recent American reports&mdash;abounding in fossil
plants, at one time regarded as Miocene, but now known
to be Lower Eocene, though farther south extending upward
toward the Miocene age.<a name="FNanchor_EP_146" id="FNanchor_EP_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_EP_146" class="fnanchor">[EP]</a> These beds, with their
characteristic plants, have been traced into the British
territory north of the forty-ninth parallel, and it has been
shown that their fossils are identical with those of the

and probably also with those of Alaska, referred to the

identity can scarcely be doubted. These facts have led
to scepticism as to the Miocene age of the upper plant-bearing
beds of Greenland, and more especially Mr. J.
Starkie Gardner has ably argued, from comparison with
the Eocene flora of England and other considerations,
that they are really of that earlier date.<a name="FNanchor_ER_148" id="FNanchor_ER_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_ER_148" class="fnanchor">[ER]</a></p>

<p>In looking at this question, we may fairly assume that
no climate, however equable, could permit the vegetation
of the neighbourhood of Disco in Greenland to be
exactly identical with that of Colorado and Missouri, at a
time when little difference of level existed in the two
regions. Either the southern flora migrated north in
consequence of a greater amelioration of climate, or the
northern flora moved southward as the climate became
colder. The same argument, as Gardner has ably shown,
applies to the similarity of the Tertiary plants of temperate
Europe to those of Greenland. If Greenland required
a temperature of about 50°, as Heer calculates, to maintain
its Eocene flora, the temperature of England and
that of the Southwestern States must have been higher,
though probably more equable, than at present.</p>

<p>We cannot certainly affirm anything respecting the
migrations of these floras, but there are some probabilities
which deserve attention. The ferns and cycads of the
so-called Lower Cretaceous of Greenland are nothing but
a continuation of the previous Jurassic flora. Now this
was established at an equally early date in the Queen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">« 246 »</a></span>
Charlotte Islands,<a name="FNanchor_ES_149" id="FNanchor_ES_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_ES_149" class="fnanchor">[ES]</a> and still earlier in Virginia,<a name="FNanchor_ET_150" id="FNanchor_ET_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_ET_150" class="fnanchor">[ET]</a> The
presumption is, therefore, that it came from the south.
It has, indeed, the facies of a southern hemisphere and
insular flora, and probably spread itself northward as far
as Greenland, at a time when our northern continents
were groups of islands, and when the ocean currents were
carrying warm water far toward the arctic regions. The
flora which succeeds this in the sections at Atané has no
special affinities with the southern hemisphere, and is of
a more temperate and continental character.<a name="FNanchor_EU_151" id="FNanchor_EU_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_EU_151" class="fnanchor">[EU]</a> It is not
necessarily Upper Cretaceous, since it is similar to that
of the Dakota group farther south, and this is at least
Middle Cretaceous. This flora must have originated
either somewhere in temperate America or within the
Arctic circle, and it must have replaced the older one by
virtue of increasing coolness and continental character of
climate. It must, therefore, have been connected with
that elevation of the land which took place at the beginning
of the Cretaceous. During this elevation it spread
over all western America at one time or another, and, as
the land again subsided under the sea of the Niobrara
chalk, it assumed an aspect more suited to a warm climate,
but still held its place on such islands as remained
above water along the Pacific coast and in the north, and
it continued to exist on these islands till the colder seas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">« 247 »</a></span>
of the Upper Cretaceous had again given place to the
warm plains and land-locked brackish seas or fresh-water
lakes of the Laramie period (Eocene). Thus the true
Upper Cretaceous marks a cool period intervening between
the so-called Upper Cretaceous (really Middle Cretaceous)
and the so-called Miocene (really Lower Eocene)
floras of Greenland.</p>

R. M. Johnston, F. L. S., states that in the Miocene beds of Tasmania trees
of European genera abound. The Mesozoic flora of that island is of the
usual conifero-cycadean type. Ettingshausen makes a similar statement
in the &ldquo;Geological Magazine&rdquo; respecting the Tertiary flora of Australia
and New Zealand, stating that, like the Tertiary floras of Europe, they
have a mixed character, being partly of types now belonging to the northern
hemisphere.</p></div>

<p>This latter established itself in Greenland, and probably
all around the Arctic circle, in the warm period of
the earliest Eocene, and, as the climate of the northern
hemisphere became gradually reduced from that time till
the end of the Pliocene, it marched on over both continents
to the southward, chased behind by the modern
arctic flora, and eventually by the frost and snow of the
Glacial age. This history may admit of correction in details;
but, so far as present knowledge extends, it is in
the main not far from the truth.</p>

<p>Perhaps the first great question which it raises is that
as to the causes of the alternations of warm and cold climates
in the north, apparently demanded by the vicissitudes
of the vegetable kingdom. Here we may set aside
the idea that in former times plants were suited to endure
greater cold than at present. It is true that some of the
fossil Greenland plants are of unknown genera, and many
are species new to us; but we are on the whole safe in
affirming that they must have required conditions similar
to those necessary to their modern representatives, except
within such limits as we now find to hold in similar cases
among existing plants. Still we know that at the present
time many species found in the equable climate of England
will not live in Canada, though species to all appearance
similar in structure are native here. There is also
some reason to suppose that species when new may have
greater hardiness and adaptability than when in old age
and verging toward extinction. In any case these facts
can account for but a small part of the phenomena, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">« 248 »</a></span>
require to be explained by physical changes affecting the
earth as a whole, or at least the northern hemisphere.
Many theoretical views have been suggested on this subject,
and perhaps the most practical way of disposing of
these will be first to set aside a number which are either
precluded by the known facts, incapable of producing
the effects, or altogether uncertain as to their possible
occurrence.</p>

<p>1. In this class we may place the theory that the poles
of the earth have changed their position. Independently
of astronomical objections, there is good geological evidence
that the poles of the earth must have been nearly
in their present places from the dawn of life until now.
From the Laurentian upward, those organic limestones
which mark the areas where warm and shallow equatorial
water was spreading over submerged continents are so
disposed as to prove the permanence of the poles. In
like manner all the great foldings of the crust of the earth
have followed lines which are parts of great circles tangent
to the existing polar circles. So, also, from the Cambrian
age the great drift of sediment from the north has followed
the line of the existing Arctic currents from the
northeast to the southwest, throwing itself, for example,
along the line of the Appalachian uplifts in eastern
America, and against the ridge of the Cordilleras in the
west.</p>

<p>2. Some of the above considerations, along with astronomical
evidence, prevent us from assuming any considerable
change in the obliquity of the axis of the earth
during geological time.</p>

<p>3. That the earth and the sun have diminished in
heat during geological time seems probable; but physical
and geological facts alike render it certain that this influence
could have produced no appreciable effect, even in
the times of the earliest floras, and certainly not in the
case of Tertiary vegetation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">« 249 »</a></span></p>

<p>4. It has been supposed that the earth may have at
different times traversed more or less heated zones of
space, giving alternations of warm and cold temperature.
No such differences in space are, however, known, nor
does there seem any good ground for imagining their existence.</p>

<p>5. The heat of the sun is known to be variable, and
the eleven years' period of sun-spots has recently attracted
much attention as producing appreciable effects on the
seasons. There may possibly be longer cycles of solar
energy, or the sun may be liable, like some variable stars,
to paroxysms of increased energy. Such changes are
possible, and may fairly be taken into the account, provided
that we fail to find known causes sufficient to account
for the phenomena.</p>

<p>Of well-known causes there seem to be but three.
These are: First, that urged by Lyell&mdash;viz., the varying
distribution of land and water along with that of marine
currents; secondly, the varying eccentricity of the earth&rsquo;s
orbit, along with the precession of the equinoxes, and the
effects of this on oceanic circulation, as illustrated by
Croll; thirdly, the different conditions of the earth&rsquo;s
atmosphere with reference to radiation, as argued by Tyndall
and Hunt. As these causes are all founded on known
facts, and not exclusive of each other, we may consider
them together. I shall take the Lyellian theory first, regarding
it as the most important, and the best supported
by geological facts.</p>

<p>We know that the present distribution of land and
water greatly influences climate, more especially by affecting
that of the ocean currents and of the winds, and
by the different action of land as compared with water in
the reception and radiation of heat. The present distribution
of land gives a large predominance to the arctic
and sub-arctic regions, as compared with the equatorial
and with the antarctic; and we might readily imagine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">« 250 »</a></span>
other distributions that would give very different results.
But this is not an imaginary case. We know that, while
the forms and positions of the great continents have been
fixed from a very early date, they have experienced many
great submergences and re-elevations, and that these have
occurred in somewhat regular sequence, as evidenced by
the cyclical alternations of organic limestones and earthy
sediments in successive geological formations.</p>

<p>An example bearing on our present subject may serve
to illustrate this. In the latter part of the Upper Silurian
period (the Lower Helderberg age), vast areas of the
American continent<a name="FNanchor_EV_152" id="FNanchor_EV_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_EV_152" class="fnanchor">[EV]</a> were covered with an ocean in
which were deposited organic limestones whose fossils
show that this great interior sea was pervaded by equatorial
waters bringing food and warmth, while the incipient
ranges of the Appalachians on the east, and the
Cordilleras on the west, and the Laurentian axis on the
north, fenced off from it the colder arctic waters. How
different must the climate of America and of the region
north of it have been in these circumstances from that
which prevails at present, or from that which prevailed
in certain other periods, when it was open to the incursions
of the arctic ice-laden currents, bearing loads of fine
sediment!<a name="FNanchor_EW_153" id="FNanchor_EW_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_EW_153" class="fnanchor">[EW]</a> It was in these circumstances, and in the
similar circumstances in which the great Corniferous
limestone of the Devonian was deposited&mdash;a limestone
showing in its rich coral fauna even warmer waters than
those of the Lower Helderberg&mdash;that the Devonian flora
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">« 251 »</a></span>
took its origin in the north and advanced southward over
new lands in process of emergence from the sea. The
somewhat similar condition evidenced by the Lower Carboniferous
limestone preceded the advent of the great and
rich flora of the coal-formation.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_EW_153" id="Footnote_EW_153"></a><a href="#FNanchor_EW_153"><span class="label">[EW]</span></a> It seems certain that the faunæ of the old limestones, like the Trenton,
Niagara, Lower Helderberg, and Corniferous, belong to warm and
sheltered sea areas, and that those rich in graptolites and trilobites, enclosed
in muddy sediments, belong to the colder arctic waters. Such
arctic faunæ are those of the Quebec group and of the Utica shale, and
to some extent that of the Hamilton group.</p></div>

<p>Lyell&rsquo;s theory on this subject has, I think, in some recent
publications, been somewhat misapprehended. It
is true that he stated hypothetically two contrasted conditions
of distribution, in one of which all the land was
equatorial, in another all polar; but he did not suppose
that these conditions had actually occurred; and even in
his earlier editions, before the recent discoveries and discussions
as to ocean currents, he was always careful to attach
due value to these in connection with subsidences
and elevations.<a name="FNanchor_EX_154" id="FNanchor_EX_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_EX_154" class="fnanchor">[EX]</a> In his later editions he introduced
more full references to current action, and also stated
Croll&rsquo;s theory, but still maintained the validity of his
original conclusions.</p>

<p>The sufficiency of this Lyellian theory to account for
the facts, in so far as plants are concerned, may, I think,
be inferred from the course of the isothermal lines at
present. The south end of Greenland is on the latitude
of Christiania in Norway on the one hand, and of Fort
Liard in the Peace River region on the other; and while
Greenland is clad in ice and snow, wheat and other grains,
and the ordinary trees of temperate climates, grow at the
latter places,<a name="FNanchor_EY_155" id="FNanchor_EY_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_EY_155" class="fnanchor">[EY]</a> It is evident, therefore, that only exceptionally
unfavourable circumstances prevent the Greenland
area from still possessing a temperate flora, and these unfavourable
circumstances possibly tell even on the localities
with which we have compared it. Further, the
mouth of the McKenzie River is in the same latitude with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">« 252 »</a></span>
Disco, near which are some of the most celebrated localities
of fossil Cretaceous and Tertiary plants. Yet the
mouth of the McKenzie River enjoys a much more favourable
climate and has a much more abundant flora than
Disco. If north Greenland were submerged, and low
land reaching to the south terminated at Disco, and if
from any cause either the cold currents of Baffin&rsquo;s Bay
were arrested, or additional warm water thrown into the
North Atlantic by the Gulf Stream, there is nothing to
prevent a mean temperature of 45° Fahr. from prevailing
at Disco; and the estimate ordinarily formed of the requirements
of its extinct floras is 50°,<a name="FNanchor_EZ_156" id="FNanchor_EZ_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_EZ_156" class="fnanchor">[EZ]</a> which is probably
above rather than below the actual temperature required.</p>

&ldquo;Nature&rdquo; for 1878.</p></div>

<p>Since, then, geological facts assure us of mutations of
the continents much greater than those apparently required
to account for the changes of climate implied in
the existence of the ancient arctic floras, it does not seem
absolutely necessary to invoke any others.<a name="FNanchor_FA_157" id="FNanchor_FA_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_FA_157" class="fnanchor">[FA]</a> If, however,
there are other true causes which might either aid or
counteract those above referred to, it may be well to
consider them.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_FA_157" id="Footnote_FA_157"></a><a href="#FNanchor_FA_157"><span class="label">[FA]</span></a> Sir William Thomson, &ldquo;Transactions of the Geological Society of
Glasgow,&rdquo; February 22, 1878.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Croll has, in his valuable work &ldquo;Climate and
Time&rdquo; and in various memoirs, brought forward an ingenious
astronomical theory to account for changes of
climate. This theory, as stated by himself in a recent
paper,<a name="FNanchor_FB_158" id="FNanchor_FB_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_FB_158" class="fnanchor">[FB]</a> is that when the eccentricity of the earth&rsquo;s orbit
is at a high value, and the northern winter solstice is in
perihelion, agencies are brought into operation which
make the southeast trade-winds stronger than the northeast,
and compel them to blow over upon the northern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">« 253 »</a></span>
hemisphere as far as the Tropic of Cancer. The result is
that all the great equatorial currents of the ocean are impelled
into the northern hemisphere, which thus, in consequence
of the immense accumulation of warm water,
has its temperature raised, so that ice and snow must to a
great extent disappear from the arctic regions. In the
prevalence of the converse conditions, the arctic zone becomes
clad in ice, and the southern has its temperature
raised.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_FB_158" id="Footnote_FB_158"></a><a href="#FNanchor_FB_158"><span class="label">[FB]</span></a> &ldquo;Cataclysmic Theories of Geological Climate,&rdquo; &ldquo;Geological Magazine,&rdquo; May, 1878.</p></div>

<p>At the same time, according to Croll&rsquo;s calculations,
the accumulation of ice on either pole would tend, by
shifting the earth&rsquo;s centre of gravity, to raise the level of
the ocean and submerge the land on the colder hemisphere.
Thus a submergence of land would coincide with a cold
condition, and emergence with increasing warmth. Facts
already referred to, however, show that this has not always
been the case, but that in many cases submergence
was accompanied with the influx of warm equatorial
waters and a raised temperature, this apparently depending
on the question of local distribution of land and
water; and this in its turn being regulated not always by
mere shifting of the centre of gravity, but by foldings occasioned
by contraction, by equatorial subsidences resulting
from the retardation of the earth&rsquo;s rotation, and by the excess
of material abstracted by ice and frost from the arctic
regions, and drifted southward along the lines of arctic
currents. This drifting must in all geological times have
greatly exceeded, as it certainly does at present, the denudation
caused by atmospheric action at the equator,
and must have tended to increase the disposition to equatorial
collapse occasioned by retardation of rotation.<a name="FNanchor_FC_159" id="FNanchor_FC_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_FC_159" class="fnanchor">[FC]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_FC_159" id="Footnote_FC_159"></a><a href="#FNanchor_FC_159"><span class="label">[FC]</span></a> Croll, in &ldquo;Climate and Time,&rdquo; and in a note read before the British
Association in 1876, takes an opposite view; but this is clearly contrary
to the facts of sedimentation, which show a steady movement of <i>débris</i>
toward the south and southwest.</p></div>

<p>While such considerations as those above referred to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">« 254 »</a></span>
tend to reduce the practical importance of Mr. Croll&rsquo;s
theory., on the other hand they tend to remove one of the
greatest objections against it&mdash;namely, that founded on
the necessity of supposing that glacial periods recur with
astronomical regularity in geological time. They cannot
do so if dependent on other causes inherent in the earth
itself, and producing important movements of its crust.</p>

<p>The third great cause of warmer climates in the past
is the larger proportion of carbon dioxide, or carbonic-acid
gas, in the atmosphere in early geological times, as
proved by the immense amount of carbon now sealed up in
limestone and coal, and which must at one time have been
in the air. It has been shown that a very small additional
quantity of this substance would so obstruct radiation of
heat from the earth as to act almost like a glass roof. If,
however, the quantity of carbonic acid, great at first, was
slowly and regularly removed, even if, as suggested by
Hunt, small additional supplies were gradually added
from space, this cause could have affected only the very
oldest floras. But it is known that some comets and
meteorites contain carbonaceous matter, and this allows
us to suppose that accessions of carbon may have been
communicated at irregular intervals. If so, there may
have been cycles of greater and less abundance of this
substance, and an atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide
might at one and the same time afford warmth and abundance
of food to plants.</p>

<p>It thus appears that the causes of ancient vicissitudes
of climate are somewhat complex, and when two or more
of them happened to coincide very extreme changes might
result, having most important bearings on the distribution
of plants.</p>

<p>This may help us to deal with the peculiarities of the
great Glacial age, which may have been rendered exceptionally
severe by the combination of several of the causes
of refrigeration. We must not suppose, however, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">« 255 »</a></span>
the views of those extreme glacialists who suppose continental
ice-caps reaching half way to the equator are borne
out by facts. In truth, the ice accumulating round the
pole must have been surrounded by water, and there must
have been tree-clad islands in the midst of the icy seas,
even in the time of greatest refrigeration. This is proved
by the fact that, in the Leda clay of eastern Canada,
which belongs to the time of greatest submergence, and
whose fossil shells show sea-water almost at the freezing-point,
there are leaves of poplars and other plants which
must have been drifted from neighbouring shores. Similar
remains occur in clays of like origin in the basin of
the great lakes and in the West. These have been called
&ldquo;interglacial,&rdquo; but there is no evidence to prove that they
are not truly glacial. Thus, while we need not suppose
that plants existed within the Arctic circle in the Glacial
age, we have evidence that those of the cold temperate
and sub-arctic zones continued to exist pretty far north.
At the same time the warm temperate flora would be
driven to the south, except where sustained in insular
spots warmed by the equatorial currents. It would return
northward on the re-elevation of the land and the renewal
of warmth.</p>

<p>If, however, our modern flora is thus one that has returned
from the south, this would account for its poverty
in species as compared with those of the early Tertiary.
Groups of plants descending from the north have been
rich and varied. Returning from the south they are like
the shattered remains of a beaten army. This, at least,
has been the case with such retreating floras as those of
the Lower Carboniferous, the Permian, and the Jurassic,
and possibly that of the Lower Eocene of Europe.</p>

<p>The question of the supply of light to an arctic flora
is much less difficult than some have imagined. The
long summer day is in this respect a good substitute for
a longer season of growth, while a copious covering of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">« 256 »</a></span>
winter snow not only protects evergreen plants from those
sudden alternations of temperature which are more destructive
than intense frost, and prevents the frost from
penetrating to their roots, but, by the ammonia which it
absorbs, preserves their greenness. According to Dr.
Brown, the Danish ladies of Disco long ago solved this
problem.<a name="FNanchor_FD_160" id="FNanchor_FD_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_FD_160" class="fnanchor">[FD]</a> He informs us that they cultivate in their
houses most of our garden flowers&mdash;as roses, fuchsias, and
geraniums&mdash;showing that it is merely warmth and not
light that is required to enable a sub-tropical flora to
thrive in Greenland. Even in Canada, which has a flora
richer in some respects than that of temperate Europe,
growth is effectually arrested by cold for nearly six
months, and though there is ample sunlight there is no
vegetation. It is, indeed, not impossible that in the
plans of the Creator the continuous summer sun of the
arctic regions may have been made the means for the introduction,
or at least for the rapid growth and multiplication,
of new and more varied types of plants.</p>

<p>Much, of course, remains to be known of the history
of the old floras, whose fortunes I have endeavoured to
sketch, and which seem to have been driven like shuttle-cocks
from north to south, and from south to north,
especially on the American continent, whose meridional
extension seems to have given a field specially suited for
such operations.</p>

<p>This great stretch of the western continent, from
north to south, is also connected with the interesting fact
that, when new floras are entering from the arctic regions,
they appear earlier in America than in Europe,
and that in times when old floras are retreating from the
south old genera and species linger longer in America.
Thus, in the Devonian and Cretaceous new forms of those
periods appear in America long before they are recognized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">« 257 »</a></span>
in Europe, and in the modern epoch forms that would be
regarded in Europe as Miocene still exist. Much confusion
in reasoning as to the geological ages of the fossil floras
has arisen from want of attention to this circumstance.</p>

<p>What we have learned respecting this wonderful history
has served strangely to change some of our preconceived
ideas. We must now be prepared to admit that
an Eden can be planted even in Spitzbergen, that there
are possibilities in this old earth of ours which its present
condition does not reveal to us; that the present state of
the world is by no means the best possible in relation to
climate and vegetation; that there have been and might
be again conditions which could convert the ice-clad arctic
regions into blooming paradises, and which at the
same time would moderate the fervent heat of the tropics.
We are accustomed to say that nothing is impossible with
God; but how little have we known of the gigantic possibilities
which lie hidden under some of the most common
of his natural laws!</p>

<p>These facts have naturally been made the occasion of
speculations as to the spontaneous development of plants
by processes of varietal derivation. It would, from this
point of view, be a nice question to calculate how many
revolutions of climate would suffice to evolve the first land-plant;
what are the chances that such plant would be so
dealt with by physical changes as to be preserved and
nursed into a meagre flora like that of the Upper Silurian
or the Jurassic; how many transportations to Greenland
would suffice to promote such meagre flora into the rich
and abundant forests of the Upper Cretaceous, and to
people the earth with the exuberant vegetation of the
early Tertiary. Such problems we may never be able to
solve. Probably they admit of no solution, unless we invoke
the action of an Almighty mind, operating through
long ages, and correlating with boundless power and wisdom
all the energies inherent in inorganic and organic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">« 258 »</a></span>
nature. Even then we shall perhaps be able to comprehend
only the means by which, after specific types have
been created, they may, by the culture of their Maker,
be &ldquo;sported&rdquo; into new varieties or subspecies, and thus
fitted to exist under different conditions or to occupy
higher places in the economy of nature.</p>

<p>Before venturing on such extreme speculations as
some now current on questions of this kind, we would
require to know the successive extinct floras as perfectly
as those of the modern world, and to be able to ascertain
to what extent each species can change either spontaneously
or under the influence of struggle for existence or
expansion under favourable conditions, and under arctic
semi-annual days and nights, or the shorter days of the
tropics. Such knowledge, if ever acquired, it may take
ages of investigation to accumulate.</p>

<p>As to the origin and mode of introduction of successive
floras, I am, for the reasons above stated, not disposed
to dogmatise, or to adopt as final any existing theory of
the development of the vegetable kingdom. Still, some
laws regulating the progress of vegetable life may be
recognised, and I propose to state these in connection
with the Palæozoic floras, to which my own studies have
chiefly related.</p>

<p>Fossil plants are almost proverbially uncertain with
reference to their accurate determination, and have been
regarded as of comparatively little utility in the decision
of general questions of palæontology. This results principally
from the fragmentary condition in which they
have been studied, and from the fact that fragments of
animal structures are more definite and instructive than
corresponding portions of plants.</p>

<p>It is to be observed, however, that our knowledge of
fossil plants becomes accurate in proportion to the extent
to which we can carry the study of specimens in the beds
in which they are preserved, so as to examine more perfect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">« 259 »</a></span>
examples than those usually to be found in museums.
When structures are taken into the account, as well as
external forms, we can also depend more confidently on
our results. Further, the abundance of specimens to be
obtained in particular beds often goes far to make up for
their individual imperfection. The writer of these pages
has been enabled to avail himself very fully of these advantages;
and on this account, if on no other, feels entitled
to speak with some authority on theoretical questions.</p>

<p>It is an additional encouragement to pursue the subject,
that, when we can obtain definite information as to
the successive floras of any region, we thereby learn much
as to climate and vicissitudes in regard to the extent of
land and water; and that, with reference to such points,
the evidence of fossil plants, when properly studied, is,
from the close relation of plants to those stations and
climates, even more valuable than that of animal fossils.</p>

<p>It is necessary, however, that in pursuing such inquiries
we should have some definite views as to the
nature and permanence of specific forms, whether with
reference to a single geological period or to successive
periods; and I may be excused for stating here some general
principles, which I think important for our guidance.</p>

<p>1. Botanists proceed on the assumption, vindicated by
experience, that, within the period of human observation,
species have not materially varied or passed into each
other. We may make, for practical purposes, the same
assumption with regard to any given geological period,
and may hold that for each such period there are specific
types which, for the time at least, are invariable.</p>

<p>2. When we inquire what constitutes a good species
for any given period, we have reason to believe that many
names in our lists represent merely varietal forms or erroneous
determinations. This is the case even in the
modern flora; and in fossil floras, through the poverty of
specimens, their fragmentary condition, and various states
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">« 260 »</a></span>
of preservation, it is still more likely to occur. Every
revision of any group of fossils detects numerous synonyms,
and of these many are incapable of detection
without the comparison of large suites of specimens.</p>

<p>3. We may select from the flora of any geological period
certain forms, which I shall call <i>specific types</i>, which
may for such period be regarded as unchanging. Having
settled such types, we may compare them with similar
forms in other periods, and such comparisons will not be
vitiated by the uncertainty which arises from the comparison
of so-called species which may, in many cases, be
mere varietal forms, as distinguished from specific types.
Our types may be founded on mere fragments, provided
that these are of such a nature as to prove that they belong
to distinct forms which cannot pass into each other,
at least within the limits of one geological period.</p>

<p>4. When we compare the specific types of one period
with those of another immediately precedent or subsequent,
we shall find that some continue unchanged
through long intervals of geological time, that others are
represented by allied forms regarded either as varietal or
specific, and as derived or otherwise, according to the
view which we may entertain as to the permanence of
species. On the other hand, we also find new types not
rationally deducible on any theory of derivation from
those known in other periods. Further, in comparing
the types of a poor period with those of one rich in species,
we may account for the appearance of new types in
the latter by the deficiency of information as to the former;
where many new types appear in the poorer period
this conclusion seems less probable. For example, new
types appearing in poor formations, like the Lower Erian
and Lower Carboniferous, have greater significance than if
they appeared in the Middle Erian or in the Coal Measures.</p>

<p>5. When specific types disappear without any known
successors, under circumstances in which it seems unlikely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">« 261 »</a></span>
that we should have failed to discover their continuance,
we may fairly assume that they have become
extinct, at least locally; and where the field of observation
is very extensive, as in the great coal-fields of Europe
and America, we may esteem such extinction as practically
general, at least for the northern hemisphere.
When many specific types become extinct together, or in
close succession, we may suppose that such extinction
resulted from physical changes; but where single types
disappear, under circumstances in which others of similar
habit continue, we may not unreasonably conjecture that,
as Pictet has argued in the case of animals, such types
may have been in their own nature limited in duration,
and may have died out without any external cause.</p>

<p>6. With regard to the <i>introduction</i> of specific types
we have not as yet a sufficient amount of information.
Even if we freely admit that ordinary specific forms, as
well as mere varieties, may result from derivation, this by
no means excludes the idea of primitive specific types
originating in some other way. Just as the chemist, after
analysing all compounds and ascertaining all allotropic
forms, arrives at length at certain elements not mutually
transmutable or derivable, so the botanist and zoölogist
must expect sooner or later to arrive at elementary
specific types, which, if to be accounted for at all, must
be explained on some principle distinct from that of
derivation. The position of many modern biologists, in
presence of this question, may be logically the same with
that of the ancient alchemists with reference to the
chemical elements, though the fallacy in the case of fossils
may be of more difficult detection. Our business at
present, in the prosecution of palæobotany, is to discover,
if possible, what are elementary or original types, and, having
found these, to enquire as to the law of their creation.</p>

<p>7. In prosecuting such questions geographical relations
must be carefully considered. When the floras of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">« 262 »</a></span>
two successive periods have existed in the same region,
and under circumstances that render it probable that
plants have continued to grow on the same or adjoining
areas throughout these periods, the comparison becomes
direct, and this is the case with the Erian and Carboniferous
floras in northeastern America. But, when the
areas of the two formations are widely separated in space
as well as in time, any resemblances of facies that we may
observe may have no connection whatever with an unbroken
continuity of specific types.</p>

<p>I desire, however, under this head, to affirm my conviction
that, with reference to the Erian and Carboniferous
floras of North America and of Europe, the doctrine
of &ldquo;homotaxis,&rdquo; as distinct from actual contemporaneity,
has no place. The succession of formations in the Palæozoic
period evidences a similar series of physical phenomena
on the grandest scale throughout the northern hemisphere.
The succession of marine animals implies the
continuity of the sea-bottoms on which they lived. The
headquarters of the Erian flora in America and Europe
must have been in connected or adjoining areas in the
North Atlantic. The similarity of the Carboniferous flora
on the two sides of the Atlantic, and the great number of
identical species, proves a still closer connection in that
period. These coincidences are too extensive and too frequently
repeated to be the result of any accident of similar
sequence at different times, and this more especially as
they extend to the more minute differences in the features
of each period, as, for instance, the floras of the
Lower and Upper Devonian, and of the Lower, Middle,
and Upper Carboniferous.</p>

<p>8. Another geographical question is that which relates
to centres of dispersion. In times of slow subsidence of
extensive areas, the plants inhabiting such areas must be
narrowed in their range and often separated from one
another in detached spots, while, at the same time, important
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">« 263 »</a></span>
climatal changes must also occur. On the re-emergence
of the land such of these species as remained would
again extend themselves over their former areas of distribution,
in so far as the new climatal and other conditions
would permit. We would naturally suppose that the first
of the above processes would tend to the elimination of
varieties, the second, to their increase; but, on the other I
hand, the breaking up of a continental flora into that of
distinct islets, and the crowding together of many forms,
might be a process fertile in the production of some varieties
if fatal to others.</p>

<p>Further, it is possible that these changes of subsidence
may have some connection with the introduction, as well
as with the extinction, even of specific types. It is certain,
at least, in the case of land-plants, that such types
come in most plentifully immediately after elevation,
though they are most abundantly preserved in periods of
slow subsidence. I do not mean, however, that this connection
is one of cause and effect; there are, indeed, indications
that it is not so. One of these is, that in some
cases the enlargement of the area of the land seems to be
as injurious to terrestrial species as its diminution.</p>

<p>9. Another point on which I have already insisted, and
which has been found to apply to the Tertiary as well as
to the Palæozoic floras, is the appearance of new types
within the arctic and boreal areas, and their migration
southward. Periods in which the existence of northern
land coincided with a general warm temperature of the
northern hemisphere seem to have been those most favourable
to the introduction of new forms of land-plants.
Hence, there has been throughout geological time a general
movement of new floras from the Palæarctic and
Nearctic regions to the southward.</p>

<p>Applying the above considerations to the Erian and
Carboniferous floras of North America, we obtain some
data which may guide us in arriving at general conclusions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">« 264 »</a></span>
The Erian flora is comparatively poor, and its
types are in the main similar to those of the Carboniferous.
Of these types a few only reappear in the middle
coal-formation under identical forms; a great number appear
under allied forms; some altogether disappear. The
Erian flora of New Brunswick and Maine occurs side by
side with the Carboniferous of the same region; so does
the Erian of New York and Pennsylvania with the Carboniferous
of those States. Thus we have data for the
comparison of successive floras in the same region. In
the Canadian region we have, indeed, in direct sequence,
the floras of the Upper Silurian, the Lower, Middle, and
Upper Erian, and the Lower, Middle, and Upper Carboniferous,
all more or less distinct from each other, and
affording an admirable series for comparison in a region
whose geographical features are very broadly marked.
All these floras are composed in great part of similar
types, and probably do not indicate very dissimilar general
physical conditions, but they are separated from each
other by the great subsidences of the Corniferous limestone
and the Lower Carboniferous limestone, and by the
local but intense subterranean action which has altered
and disturbed the Erian beds toward the close of that
period. Still, these changes were not universal. The
Corniferous limestone is absent in Gaspé, and probably in
New Brunswick, where, consequently, the Erian flora
could continue undisturbed during that long period.
The Carboniferous limestone is absent from the slopes of
the Appalachians in Pennsylvania, where a retreat may
have been afforded to the Upper Erian and Lower Carboniferous
floras. The disturbances at the close of the
Erian were limited to those eastern regions where the
great limestone-producing subsidences were unfelt, and,
on the other hand, are absent in Ohio, where the subsidences
and marine conditions were almost at a maximum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">« 265 »</a></span></p>

<p>Bearing in mind these peculiarities of the area in
question, we may now group in a tabular form the distinct
specific types recognised in the Erian system, indicating,
at the same time, those which are represented by
identical species in the Carboniferous, those represented
by similar species of the same general type, and those not
represented at all. For example, <i>Calamites cannæformis</i>
extends as a species into the Carboniferous; <i>Asterophyllites
latifolia</i> does not so extend, but is represented by
closely allied species of the same type; <i>Nematophyton</i>
disappears altogether before we reach the Carboniferous.</p>

<p>Of the above forms, fifty-one in all, found in the Erian
of eastern America, all, except the last four, are certainly
distinct specific types. Of these only four reappear in the
Carboniferous under identical species, but no less than
twenty-six reappear under representative or allied forms,
some at least of which a derivationist might claim as
modified descendants. On the other hand, nearly one
half of the Devonian types are unknown in the Carboniferous,
while there remain a very large number of Carboniferous
types not accounted for by anything known in
the Devonian. Further, a very poor flora, including only
two or three types, is the predecessor of the Erian flora in
the Upper Silurian, and the flora again becomes poor in
the Upper Devonian and Lower Carboniferous. Every
new species discovered must more or less modify the above
statements, and the whole Erian flora of America, as well
as the Carboniferous, requires a thorough comparison with
that of Europe before general conclusions can be safely
drawn. In the mean time I may indicate the direction in
which the facts seem to point by the following general
statements:</p>

<p>1. Some of the forms reckoned as specific in the Devonian
and Carboniferous may be really derivative races.
There are indications that such races may have originated
in one or more of the following ways: (1) By a natural
tendency in synthetic types to become specialised in the
direction of one or other of their constituent elements.
In this way such plants as <i>Arthrostigma</i> and <i>Psilophyton</i>
may have assumed new varietal forms. (2) By embryonic
retardation or acceleration,<a name="FNanchor_FE_161" id="FNanchor_FE_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_FE_161" class="fnanchor">[FE]</a> whereby certain species
may have had their maturity advanced or postponed, thus
giving them various grades of perfection in reproduction
and complexity of structure. The fact that so many
Erian and Carboniferous plants seem to be on the confines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">« 267 »</a></span>
of the groups of Acrogens and Gymnosperms may
be supposed favourable to such exchanges. (3) The contraction
and breaking up of floras, as occurred in the
Middle Erian and Lower Carboniferous, may have been
eminently favourable to the production of such varietal
forms as would result from what has been called the
&ldquo;struggle for existence.&rdquo; (4) The elevation of a great
expanse of new land at the close of the Middle Erian and
the beginning of the coal period would, by permitting
the extension of species over wide areas and fertile soils,
and by removing the pressure previously existing, be
eminently favourable to the production of new, and especially
of improved, varieties.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_FE_161" id="Footnote_FE_161"></a><a href="#FNanchor_FE_161"><span class="label">[FE]</span></a> In the manner illustrated by Hyatt and Cope.</p></div>

<p>2. Whatever importance we may attach to the above
supposed causes of change, we still require to account
for the origin of our specific types. This may forever
elude our observation, but we may at least hope to ascertain
the external conditions favourable to their production.
In order to attain even to this it will be necessary
to inquire critically, with reference to every acknowledged
species, what its claims to distinctness are, so that
we may be enabled to distinguish specific types from
mere varieties. Having attained to some certainty in
this, we may be prepared to inquire whether the conditions
favourable to the appearance of new varieties were
also those favourable to the creation of new types, or the
reverse&mdash;whether these conditions were those of compression
or expansion, or to what extent the appearance of
new types may be independent of any external conditions,
other than those absolutely necessary for their
existence. I am not without hope that the further study
of fossil plants may enable us thus to approach to a comprehension
of the laws of the creation, as distinguished
from those of the continued existence of species.</p>

<p>3. In the present state of our knowledge we have no
good ground either to limit the number of specific types
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">« 268 »</a></span>
beyond what a fair study of our material may warrant,
or to infer that such primitive types must necessarily
have been of low grade, or that progress in varietal forms
has always been upward. The occurrence of such an
advanced and specialised type as that of <i>Dadoxylon</i>
in the Middle Devonian should guard us against these
errors. The creative process may have been applicable
to the highest as well as to the lowest forms, and subsequent
deviations must have included degradation as well
as elevation. I can conceive nothing more unreasonable
than the statement sometimes made that it is illogical or
even absurd to suppose that highly organised beings
could have been produced except by derivation from previously
existing organisms. This is begging the whole
question at issue, depriving science of a noble department
of inquiry on which it has as yet barely entered, and anticipating
by unwarranted assertions conclusions which
may perhaps suddenly dawn upon us through the inspiration
of some great intellect, or may for generations to
come baffle the united exertions of all the earnest promoters
of natural science. Our present attitude should
not be that of dogmatists, but that of patient workers
content to labour for a harvest of grand generalisations
which may not come till we have passed away, but which,
if we are earnest and true to Nature and its Creator, may
reward even some of us.</p>

<p>Within the human period great changes of distribution
of plants have occurred, chiefly through the agency
of man himself, and we have had ample evidence that
plants are able to establish themselves and prosper in
climates and conditions to which unaided they could not
have transported themselves, as, for instance, in the case
of European weeds naturalised in Australia and New Zealand.
There is, however, no reason to believe that any
specific change has occurred to any plant within the Pleistocene
or modern period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">« 269 »</a></span></p>

<p>In a recent address, delivered to the biological section
of the British Association, Mr. Carruthers has discussed
this question, and has shown that the earliest vegetable
specimens described by Dr. Schweinfurth from the Egyptian
tombs present no appearance of change. This fact
appears also in the leaves and other organs of plants preserved
in the nodules in the Pleistocene clays of the Ottawa,
and in specimens of similar age found in various
places in Britain and the continent of Europe.<a name="FNanchor_FF_162" id="FNanchor_FF_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_FF_162" class="fnanchor">[FF]</a></p>

Canada,&rdquo; Canadian Naturalist, 1866.</p></div>

<p>The difficulties attending the ordinary theories of
evolution as applied to plants have been well set forth by
the same able botanist in his &ldquo;Presidential Address to
the Geological Association in 1877,&rdquo; a paper which deserves
careful study. One of his illustrations is that
ancient willow, <i>Salix polaris</i>, referred to in a previous
chapter, which now lives in the arctic regions, and is
found fossil in the Pleistocene beds at Cromer and at
Bovey Tracey.</p>

<p>He notes the fact that the genus <i>Salix</i> is a very variable
one, including 19 subgeneric groups and 160 species,
with no less than 222 varieties and 70 hybrids. <i>Salix
polaris</i> belongs to a subgeneric group containing 29
species, which are arranged in four sections, that to
which <i>S. polaris</i> belongs containing six species. Now it
is easy to construct a theoretical phylogeny of the derivation
of the willows from a supposed ancestral source,
but when we take our little <i>S. polaris</i> we find that this
one twig of our ancestral tree takes us back without
change to the Glacial period. The six species would take
us still farther, and the sections, sub-genera, and genus
at the same rate would require an incalculable amount of
past time. He concludes the inquiry in the following
terms:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">« 270 »</a></span></p>

<p>"But when we have reached the branch representing
the generic form we have made but little progress in the
phylogenesis of <i>Salix</i>. With <i>Populus</i> this genus forms
a small order, Salicineæ, The two genera are closely
allied, yet separated by well-marked characters; it is
not, however, difficult to conceive of both having sprung
from a generalised form. But there is no record of such
a form. The two genera appear together among the
earliest known dicotyledons, the willows being represented
by six and the poplars by nine species. The ordinal
form, if it ever existed, must necessarily be much
older than the period of the Upper Cretaceous rocks,
that is, than the period to which the earliest known
dicotyledons belong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Salicineæ are related to five other natural
orders, in all of which the apetalous flowers are arranged
in catkins. These different though allied orders must
be led up by small modifications to a generalised amentiferous
type, and thereafter the various groups of apetalous
plants by innumerable eliminations of differentiating
characters until the primitive form of the apetalous plant
is reached. Beyond this the uncurbed imagination will
have more active work in bridging over the gap between
Angiosperms and Gymnosperms, in finding the intermediate
forms that led up to the vascular cryptogams, and
on through the cellular plants to the primordial germ.
Every step in this phylogenetic tree must be imagined.
The earliest dicotyledon takes us not a step farther back
in the phylogenetic history of <i>Salix</i> than that supplied
by existing vegetation. All beyond the testimony of our
living willows is pure imagination, unsupported by a
single fact. So that here, also, the evidence is against
evolution, and there is none in favour of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is easy to see that similar difficulties beset every
attempt to trace the development of plants on the principle
of slow and gradual evolution, and we are driven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">« 271 »</a></span>
back on the theory of periods of rapid origin, as we have
already seen suggested by Saporta in the case of the Cretaceous
dicotyledons. Such abrupt and plentiful introduction
of species over large areas at the same time, by
whatever cause effected&mdash;and we are at present quite ignorant
of any secondary causes&mdash;becomes in effect something
not unlike the old and familiar idea of creation. Science
must indeed always be baffled by questions of ultimate
origin, and, however far it may be able to trace the chain
of secondary causation and development, must at length
find itself in the presence of the great Creative Mind,
who is &ldquo;before all things and in whom all things consist.&rdquo;</p>

I.&mdash;COMPARATIVE VIEW OF THE SUCCESSIVE PALÆOZOIC<br />
FLORAS OF NORTHEASTERN AMERICA AND<br />

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> eastern Canada there is a very complete series of fossil plants,
extending from the Silurian to the Permian, and intermediate in its
species between the floras of interior America and of Europe. I may
use this succession, mainly worked out by myself,<a name="FNanchor_FG_163" id="FNanchor_FG_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_FG_163" class="fnanchor">[FG]</a> to summarise the
various Palæozoic floras and sub-floras, in order to give a condensed
view of this portion of the history of the vegetable kingdom, and to
direct attention to the important fact, too often overlooked, that
there is a definite succession of fossil plants as well as of animals,
and that this is important as a means of determining geological
horizons. A British list for comparison has been kindly prepared
for me by Mr. R. Kidston, F. Gr. S. For lists referring to the western
and southern portions of America, I may refer to the reports of
Lesquereux and Fontaine and White.<a name="FNanchor_FH_164" id="FNanchor_FH_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_FH_164" class="fnanchor">[FH]</a></p>

in Africa, that the flora which in the Carboniferous period extended
over the temperate portions of the northern hemisphere and far into
the arctic, also passed across the equator and prevailed in the southern
hemisphere. Of eleven species brought from the Zambesi by M.
Lapierre and examined by M. Zeiller, all were identical with European
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">« 274 »</a></span>
species of the upper coal-formation, and the same fact has been
observed in the coal flora of the Cape Colony.<a name="FNanchor_FJ_166" id="FNanchor_FJ_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_FJ_166" class="fnanchor">[FJ]</a> These facts bear
testimony to the remarkable uniformity of climate and vegetation in
the coal period, and I perfectly agree with Zeiller that they show,
when taken in connection with other parallelisms in fossils, an actual
contemporaneousness of the coal flora over the whole world.</p>

<p class="caption3">1. Carboniferous Flora.</p>

<p class="p0">(1) <i>Permo-Carboniferous Sub-Flora</i>:</p>

<p>This occurs in the upper member of the Carboniferous system of
Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, originally named by the
writer the Newer Coal-formation, and more recently the Permo-Carboniferous,
and the upper beds of which may not improbably be
contemporaneous with the Lower Permian or Lower Dyas of Europe.
In this formation there is a predominance of red sandstones and
shales, and it contains no productive beds of coal. Its fossil plants
are for the most part of species found in the Middle or Productive
Coal-formation, but are less numerous, and there are a few new forms
akin to those of the European Permian. The most characteristic
species of the upper portion of the formation, which has the most
decidedly Permian aspect, are the following:</p>

<p>Of these species, those marked with an asterisk have not yet been
found in the middle or lower members of the Carboniferous system.
They will be found described, and several of them figured, in my
&ldquo;Report on the Geology of Prince Edward Island.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_FK_167" id="FNanchor_FK_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_FK_167" class="fnanchor">[FK]</a> The others are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">« 275 »</a></span>
common and widely diffused Carboniferous species, some of which
have extended to the Permian period in Europe as well. From the
upper beds, characterised by these and a few other species, there is a
gradual passage downward into the productive coal-measures, and a
gradually increasing number of true coal-formation species.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_FK_167" id="Footnote_FK_167"></a><a href="#FNanchor_FK_167"><span class="label">[FK]</span></a> 1871.</p></div>

<p>It is worthy of remark here that the association in the Permo-Carboniferous
of numerous trunks of <i>Dadoxylon</i> with the branches
of <i>Walchia</i> and with fruits of the character of <i>Trigonocarpa</i>, seems
to show that these were parts of one and the same plant.</p>

<p>This formation represents the Upper Barren Measures of West
Virginia, which are well described by Fontaine and White,<a name="FNanchor_FL_168" id="FNanchor_FL_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_FL_168" class="fnanchor">[FL]</a> and the
reasons which these authors adduce for considering the latter equivalent
to the European Permian will apply to the more northern and
eastern deposits as well, though these have afforded fewer species of
plants, and are apparently less fully developed.</p>

Pennsylvania,&rdquo; 1880.</p></div>

<p class="p0">(2) <i>Coal-formation Sub-Flora</i>:</p>

<p>The Middle or Productive Coal-formation, containing all the beds
of coal which are mined in Nova Scotia and Cape Breton, is the headquarters
of the Carboniferous flora. From this formation I have
catalogued<a name="FNanchor_FM_169" id="FNanchor_FM_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_FM_169" class="fnanchor">[FM]</a> one hundred and thirty-five species of plants; but, as
several of these are founded on imperfect specimens, the number of
actual species may be estimated at one hundred and twenty. Of
these more than one half are species common to Europe and America.
No less than nineteen species are <i>Sigillariæ</i>, and about the same
number are <i>Lepidodendra</i>. About fifty are ferns and thirteen are
<i>Calamites</i>, <i>Asterophyllites</i>, and <i>Sphenophylla</i>. The great abundance
and number of species of Sigillariæ, Lepidodendra, and ferns are
characteristic of this sub-flora; and among the ferns certain species
of <i>Neuropteris</i>, <i>Pecopteris</i>, <i>Alethopteris</i>, and <i>Sphenopteris</i> greatly
preponderate.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_FM_169" id="Footnote_FM_169"></a><a href="#FNanchor_FM_169"><span class="label">[FM]</span></a> &ldquo;Acadian Geology,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Report on Flora of Lower Carboniferous,&rdquo; 1873.</p></div>

<p>These beds are the equivalents of the Middle Coal-measures, or
Productive Coal-measures of Pennsylvania, Ohio, &amp;c., and of the
coal-formation proper of various European countries. Very many
of the species are common to Nova Scotia and Pennsylvania; but in
proceeding westward the number of identical species seems to diminish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">« 276 »</a></span></p>

<p class="p0">(3) <i>The Millstone Grit Sub-Flora</i>:</p>

<p>In this formation the abundance of plants and the number of
species are greatly diminished.<a name="FNanchor_FN_170" id="FNanchor_FN_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_FN_170" class="fnanchor">[FN]</a> Trunks of coniferous trees of the
species <i>Dadoxylon Acadianum</i>, having wide wood-cells with three
or more series of discs and complex medullary rays, become characteristic.
<i>Calamites undulatum</i> is abundant and seems to replace <i>C.
Suckovii</i>, though <i>C. cannæformis</i> and <i>C. cistii</i> continue. <i>Sigillariæ</i>
become very rare, and the species of Lepidodendron are few, and
mostly those with large leaf-bases. <i>Lepidophloios</i> still continues, and
<i>Cordaites</i> abounds in some beds. The ferns are greatly reduced,
though a few characteristic coal-formation species occur, and the
genus <i>Cardiopteris</i> appears. Beds of coal are rare in this formation;
but where they occur there is in connection with them a remarkable
anticipation of the rich coal-formation flora, which would thus seem
to have existed locally in the Millstone Grit period, but to have
found itself limited by generally unfavorable conditions. In America,
as in Europe, it is in the north that this earlier development of
the coal-flora occurs, while in the south there is a lingering of old
forms in the newer beds. In Newfoundland and Cape Breton, for
instance, as well as in Scotland, productive coal-beds and a greater
variety of species of plants occur in this formation.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_FN_170" id="Footnote_FN_170"></a><a href="#FNanchor_FN_170"><span class="label">[FN]</span></a> &ldquo;Report on Fossil Plants of the Lower Carboniferous and Millstone
Grit of Canada,&rdquo; 1873.</p></div>

<p>The following would appear to be the equivalents of this formation,
in flora and geological position:</p>

<p>1. The Seral Conglomerate of Rogers in Pennsylvania, &amp;c.</p>

<p>2. The Lower Coal-formation Conglomerate and Chester groups
of Illinois (Worthen).</p>

<p>3. The Lower Carboniferous Sandstone of Kentucky, Alabama,
and Virginia.</p>

<p>4. The Millstone Grit and Yoredale rocks of northern England,
and the Culmiferous of Devonshire.</p>

<p>5. The Moor rock and Lower Coal-measures of Scotland.</p>

<p>6. Flagstones and Lower Shales of the south of Ireland, and Millstone
Grit of the north of Ireland.</p>

<p>7. The Jüngste Grauwacke of the Hartz, Saxony, and Silesia.</p>

<p class="p0">(4) <i>The Carboniferous Limestone Series</i>:</p>

<p>This affords few fossil plants in eastern America, and in so far as
known they are similar to those of the next group. In Scotland it
is richer in plants, but, according to Mr. Kidston, these are largely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">« 277 »</a></span>
similar to those of the underlying beds, though with some species
which extend upward into the Millstone Grit. In Scotland the alga
named <i>Spirophyton</i> and <i>Archæocalamites radiatus</i>&mdash;which in America
are Erian&mdash;appear in this formation.</p>

<p class="p0">(5) <i>The Lower Carboniferous Sub-Flora</i>:</p>

<p>This group of plants is best seen in the shales of the Horton
series, under the Lower Carboniferous marine limestones. It is
small and peculiar. The most characteristic species are the following:</p>

<p><i>Dadoxylon</i> (<i>Palæoxylon</i>) <i>antiquius</i>, Dn.&mdash;A species with large
medullary rays of three or more series of cells.</p>

<p><i>Lepidodendron corrugatum</i>, Dn.&mdash;A species closely allied to <i>L.
Veltheimianum</i> of Europe, and which is its American representative.
This is perhaps the most characteristic plant of the formation. It
is very abundant, and presents very protean appearances, in its old
stems, branches, twigs, and <i>Knorria</i> forms. It had well-characterised
stigmaria roots, and constitutes the oldest erect forest known in
Nova Scotia.</p>

<p><i>Lepidodendron tetragonum</i>, Sternberg.</p>

<p><i>L. obovatum</i>, Sternb.</p>

<p><i>L. aculeatum</i>, Sternb.</p>

<p><i>L. dichotomum</i>, Sternb.</p>

<p>The four species last mentioned are comparatively rare, and the
specimens are usually too imperfect to render their identification
certain, but Lepidodendra are especially characteristic trees of this
horizon.</p>

<p><i>Cyclopteris</i> (<i>Aneimites</i>) <i>Acadica</i>, Dn.&mdash;A very characteristic fern,
allied in the form of its fronds to <i>C. tenuifolia</i> of Goeppert, to <i>C.
nana</i> of Eichwald, and to <i>Adiantites antiquus</i> of Stur. Its fructification,
however, is nearer to that of <i>Aneimia</i> than to that of <i>Adiantum</i>.</p>

<p>Ferns of the genera Cardiopteris and <i>Hymenophyllites</i> also occur,
though rarely.</p>

<p><i>Ptilophyton plumula</i>, Dn.&mdash;This is the latest appearance of this
Erian genus, which also occurs in the Lower Carboniferous of Europe
and of the United States.</p>

<p><i>Cordaites borassifolia</i>, Brongt.</p>

<p>On the whole, this small flora is markedly distinct from that of
the Millstone Grit and true coal-formation, from which it is separated
by the great length of time required for the deposition of the
marine limestones and their associated beds, in which no land-plants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">« 278 »</a></span>
have been found; nor is this gap filled up by the conglomerates and
coarse arenaceous beds which, as I have explained in &ldquo;Acadian Geology,&rdquo;
in some localities take the place of the limestones, as they do
also in the Appalachian region farther south.</p>

<p>The palæobotanical and stratigraphical equivalents of this series
abroad would seem to be the following:</p>

<p>1. The Vespertine group of Rogers in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>2. The Kinderhook group of Worthen in Illinois.</p>

<p>3. The Marshall group of Winchell in Michigan.</p>

<p>4. The Waverley sandstone (in part) of Ohio.</p>

<p>5. The Lower or False Coal-measures of Virginia.</p>

<p>6. The Calciferous sandstones of McLaren, or Tweedian group of
Tate in Scotland.</p>

<p>7. The Lower Carboniferous slate and Coomhala grits of Jukes
in Ireland.</p>

<p>8. The Culm and Culm Grauwacke of Germany.</p>

<p>9. The Graywacke or Lower Coal-measures of the Vosges, as described
by Schimper.</p>

<p>10. The Older Coal-formation of the Ural, as described by Eichwald.</p>

<p>11. The so-called &ldquo;Ursa Stage&rdquo; of Heer includes this, but he has
united it with Devonian beds, so that the name cannot be used except
for the local development of these beds at Bear Island, Spitsbergen.
The Carboniferous plants of arctic America, Melville Island,
&amp;c., as well as those of Spitzbergen, appear all to be Lower
Carboniferous.<a name="FNanchor_FO_171" id="FNanchor_FO_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_FO_171" class="fnanchor">[FO]</a></p>

of Canada,&rdquo; by Dr. G. M. Dawson, 1887.</p></div>

<p>All of the above groups of rocks are characterised by the prevalence
of <i>Lepidodendra</i> of the type of <i>L. corrugatum</i>, <i>L. Veltheimianum</i>,
and <i>L. Glincanum</i>; pines of the sub-genus <i>Pitus</i> of Witham,
<i>Palæoxylon</i> of Brongniart, and peculiar ferns of the genera <i>Cyclopteris</i>,
<i>Cardiopteris</i>, <i>Triphyllopteris</i>, and <i>Sphenopteris</i>. In all the
regions above referred to they form the natural base of the great
Carboniferous system.</p>

<p>In Virginia, according to Fontaine and White, types, such as
Archæopteris, which in the north are Upper Erian, occur in this
group. Unless there have been some errors in fixing the lower limit
of the Vespertine, this would indicate a longer continuance of old
forms in the south.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">« 279 »</a></span></p>

<p class="caption3">2. Erian Flora.</p>

<p class="p0">(1) <i>Upper Erian Sub-Flora</i>:</p>

<p>This corresponds to the Catskill and Chemung of the New York
series, and to the Upper Devonian of Europe.</p>

<p>The flora of this formation, which consists mostly of sandstones,
is not rich. Its most distinctive species on both sides of the Atlantic
seem to be the ferns of the genus <i>Archæopteris</i>, along with species
referred to the genus <i>Cyclopteris</i>, but which, in so far as their barren
fronds are concerned, for the most part resemble <i>Archæopteris</i>.</p>

<p>The characteristic American species are <i>Archæopteris Jacksoni</i>,
<i>A. Rogersi</i>, and <i>A. Gaspiensis</i>. <i>Cyclopteris obtusa</i> and <i>C.</i> (<i>Platyphyllum</i>)
<i>Brownii</i> are also very characteristic species. In Europe,
<i>Archæopteris Hibernica</i> is a prevalent species.</p>

<p><i>Leptophleum rhombicum</i> and fragments of <i>Psilophyton</i> are also
found in the Upper Erian. There is evidence of the existence of
vast numbers of <i>Rhizocarps</i> in this period, in the deposits of spore-cases
(<i>Sporangites Huronensis</i>) in the shales of Kettle Point, Lake
Huron; and in deposits of similar character in Ohio and elsewhere
in the West.</p>

<p>The Upper Erian flora is thus very distinct from that of the
Lower Carboniferous, and the unconformable relation of the beds in
the Northeast may perhaps indicate a considerable lapse of time.
Still, even in localities where there appears to be a transition from
the Carboniferous into the Devonian, as in the Western States and
in Ireland, the characteristic flora of each formation may be distinguished,
though, as already stated, there is apparently some mixture
in the South.</p>

<p class="p0">(2) <i>Middle Erian Sub-Flora</i>:</p>

<p>Both in Canada and the United States that part of the great
Erian system which may be regarded as its middle division, the
Hamilton and Marcellus shales of New York, the Cordaites shales of
St. John, New Brunswick, and the middle shales and sandstones of
the Gaspé series, presents conditions more favourable to the abundant
growth of land-plants than either the upper or lower member. In
the St. John beds, in particular, there is a rich fern flora, comparable
with that of the coal-formation, and numerous stipes of ferns and
trunks of tree-ferns have been found in the Hamilton and Corniferous
series in the West, as well as trunks of <i>Dadoxylon</i>. It is, however,
distinguished by a prevalence of small and delicate species, and
by such forms as <i>Hymenophyllites</i> and the smaller Sphenopterids,
and also by some peculiar ferns, as <i>Archæopteris</i> and <i>Megalopteris</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">« 280 »</a></span>
In addition to ferns, it has small <i>Lepidodendra</i>, of which <i>L. Gaspianum</i>
is the chief. <i>Calamiteæ</i> occur, <i>Archæocalamites radiatus</i> being
the dominant species. This plant, which in Europe appears to reach
up into the Lower Carboniferous, is so far strictly Erian in northeast
America. <i>Sigillariæ</i> scarcely appear, but <i>Cordaites</i> is abundant,
and the earliest known species of <i>Dadoxylon</i> appear, while the
Psilophyton, so characteristic of the Lower Erian, still continues,
and the remarkable aquatic plants of the genus <i>Ptilophyton</i> are
locally abundant.</p>

<p class="p0">(3) <i>Lower Erian Sub-Flora</i>:</p>

<p>This belongs to the Lower Devonian sandstones and shales, and
is best seen in that formation at Gaspé and the Bay des Chaleurs. It
is equivalent to the Oriskany sandstone, so far as its animal fossils
and mineral character are concerned. It is characterised by the absence
of true ferns, <i>Calamites</i> and <i>Sigillariæ</i>, and by the presence
of such forms as <i>Psilophyton</i>, <i>Arthrostigma</i>, <i>Leptophleum</i>, and <i>Nematophyton</i>.
<i>Lepidodendron Gaspianum</i> and <i>Leptophleum</i> already
occur, though not nearly so abundant as Psilophyton.</p>

<p>The Lower Erian plants have an antique and generalised aspect
which would lead us to infer that they are near the beginning of the
land-flora, or perhaps in part belong to the close of an earlier flora
still in great part unknown and few indications of land-plants have
been found earlier.</p>

<p>At Campbellton and Scaumenac Bay, on the Bay des Chaleurs,
fossil fishes of genera characteristic of the Lower and Upper Devonian
horizons respectively, occur in association with fossil plants
of these horizons, and have been described by Mr. Whiteaves.<a name="FNanchor_FP_172" id="FNanchor_FP_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_FP_172" class="fnanchor">[FP]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_FP_172" id="Footnote_FP_172"></a><a href="#FNanchor_FP_172"><span class="label">[FP]</span></a> &ldquo;Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>It is interesting to note that, as Fontaine and White have observed,
certain forms which are Erian in the northeast are found in
the Lower members of the Carboniferous in West Virginia, indicating
the southward march of species in these periods.</p>

<p class="caption3">3. The Silurian Flora and still Earlier Indications of
Plants.</p>

<p>In the upper beds of the Silurian, those of the Helderberg series,
we still find <i>Psilophyton</i> and <i>Nematophyton</i>; but below these we
know no land-plants in Canada. In the United States, Lesquereux
and Claypole have described remains which may indicate the existence
of lycopodiaceous and annularian types as far back as the beginning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">« 281 »</a></span>
of the Upper Silurian, or even as low as the Hudson River
group, and Hicks has found <i>Nematophyton</i> and <i>Psilophyton</i> in beds
about as old in Wales, along with the uncertain stems named <i>Berwynia</i>.
In the Lower Silurian the <i>Protannularia</i> of the Skiddaw
series in England may represent a land-plant, but this is uncertain,
and no similar species has been found in Canada.</p>

<p>The Cambrian rocks are so far barren of land-plants; the so-called
<i>Eophyton</i> being evidently nothing but markings, probably
produced by crustaceans and other aquatic animals. In the still
older Laurentian the abundant beds of graphite probably indicate
the existence of plants, but whether aquatic or terrestrial it is impossible
to decide at present.</p>

<p>It would thus appear that our certain knowledge of land-vegetation
begins with the Upper Silurian or the Silurio-Cambrian, and
that its earliest forms were Acrogens allied to Lycopods, and prototypal
trees, forerunners of the Acrogens or the gymnosperms. In
the Lower Devonian little advance is made. In the Middle Devonian
this meagre flora had been replaced by one rivalling that of the Carboniferous,
and including pines, tree-ferns, and arboreal forms of
Lycopods and of equisetaceous plants, as well as numerous herbaceous
plants. At the close of the Erian the flora again became
meagre, and continued so in the Lower Carboniferous. It again became
rich and varied in the Middle Carboniferous, to decay in the
succeeding Permian.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A very</span> valuable report of Prof. Steenstrup, published in Copenhagen
in 1883, the year in which Heer died, contains the results of
his last work on the Greenland plants, and is so important that a

<p>The plant-bearing beds of Greenland are as follows, in ascending
order:</p>

<p class="caption3">1. <span class="smcap">Cretaceous</span>.</p>

<p>1. The <i>Komé</i> series, of black shales resting on the Laurentian
gneiss. These beds are found at various other localities, but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">« 282 »</a></span>
name above given is that by which they are generally known. Their
flora is limited to ferns, cycads, conifers, and a few endogens, with
only <i>Populus primæva</i> to represent the dicotyledons. These beds
are regarded as Lower Cretaceous (Urgonian), but the animal fossils
would seem to give them a rather higher position. They may be
regarded as equivalent to the Kootanie and Queen Charlotte beds in
Canada, and the Potomac series in Virginia.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Atané</i> series. These also are black shales with dark-coloured
sandstones. They are best exposed at Upernavik and
Waigat. Here dicotyledonous leaves abound, amounting to ninety
species, or more than half the whole number of species found.
The fossil plants resemble those of the Dakota series of the United
States and the Dunvegan series of Canada, and the animal fossils
indicate the horizon of the Fort Pierre or its lower part. They may
be regarded as representing the lower part of the Upper Cretaceous.
The genera <i>Populus</i>, <i>Myrica</i>, <i>Quercus</i>, <i>Ficus</i>, <i>Platanus</i>, <i>Sassafras</i>,
<i>Laurus</i>, <i>Magnolia</i>, and <i>Liriodendron</i> are among those represented
in these beds, and the peculiar genera <i>Macclintockia</i> and <i>Credneria</i>
are characteristic. The genus <i>Pinus</i> is represented by five species,
<i>Sequoia</i> by five, and <i>Salisburia</i> by two, with three of the allied
genus <i>Baiera</i>. There are many ferns and cycads.</p>

<p>3. The <i>Patoot</i> series. These are yellow and red shales, which
seem to owe their colour to the spontaneous combustion of pyritous
lignite, in the manner observed on the South Saskatchewan and the
Mackenzie rivers. Their age is probably about that of the Fox-Hill
group or Senonian, and the Upper Cretaceous of Vancouver Island,
and they afford a large proportion of dicotyledonous leaves. The
genera of dicotyledons are not dissimilar from those of Atané, but
we now recognise <i>Betula</i> and <i>Alnus</i>, <i>Comptonia</i>, <i>Planera</i>, <i>Sapotacites</i>,
<i>Fraxinus</i>, <i>Viburnum</i>, <i>Cornus</i>, <i>Acer</i>, <i>Celastrus</i>, <i>Paliurus</i>,
<i>Ceanothus</i>, <i>Zizyphus</i>, and <i>Cratægus</i> as new genera of modern aspect.</p>

<p>On the whole there have been found in all these beds 335 species,
belonging to 60 families, of which 36 are dicotyledonous, and represent
all the leading types of arborescent dicotyledons of the temperate
latitudes. The flora is a warm temperate one, with some remarkable
mixtures of sub-tropical forms, among which perhaps the
most remarkable are <i>Kaidocarpum</i> referred to the <i>Pandaneæ</i>, and
such exogens as <i>Ficus</i> and <i>Cinnamomum</i>.</p>

<p class="caption3">2. <span class="smcap">Tertiary</span>.</p>

<p>4. The <i>Unartok</i> series. This is believed to be Eocene. It consists
of sandstone, which appears on the shores of Disco Island, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">« 283 »</a></span>
possibly at some other places on the coast. The beds rest directly
and apparently conformably on the Upper Cretaceous, and have afforded
only eleven species of plants. <i>Magnolia</i> is represented by
two species, <i>Laurus</i> by two, <i>Platanus</i> by two, and one of these said
to be identical with a species found by Lesquereux in the Laramie,<a name="FNanchor_FR_174" id="FNanchor_FR_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_FR_174" class="fnanchor">[FR]</a>
<i>Viburnum</i>, <i>Juglans</i>, <i>Quercus</i>, each by one species; the ubiquitous
<i>Sequoias</i> by <i>S. Langsdorfii</i>. This is pretty clearly a Lower Laramie
flora.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_FR_174" id="Footnote_FR_174"></a><a href="#FNanchor_FR_174"><span class="label">[FR]</span></a> <i>Viburnum marginatum</i> of Lesquereux.</p></div>

<p>5. The <i>Atanekerdluk</i> series, consisting of shaly beds, with limestone
intercalated between great sheets of basalt, much like the
Eocene of Antrim and the Hebrides. These beds have yielded 187
species, principally in bands and concretions of siderite, and often
in a good state of preservation. They are referred to the Lower
Miocene, but, as explained in the text, the flora is more nearly akin
to that of the Eocene of Europe and the Laramie of America. The
animal fossils are chiefly fresh-water shells. <i>Onoclea sensibilis</i>,
several conifers, as <i>Taxites</i> <i>Olriki</i>, <i>Taxodium distichum</i>, <i>Glyptostrobus
Europæus</i>, and <i>Sequoia Langsdorfii</i>, and 42 of the dicotyledons
are recognised as found also in American localities. Of these, a
large proportion of the more common species occur in the Laramie
of the Mackenzie River and elsewhere in northwest Canada, and in
the western United States. It is quite likely also that several species
regarded as distinct may prove to be identical.</p>

<p>It would seem that throughout the whole thickness of these
Tertiary beds the flora is similar, so that it is probable it belongs altogether
to the Eocene rather than to the Miocene.</p>

<p>No indication has been observed of any period of cold intervening
between the Lower Cretaceous and the top of the Tertiary deposits,
so that, in all the vast period which these formations represent, the
climate of Greenland would seem to have been temperate. There
is, however, as is the case farther south, evidence of a gradual diminution
of temperature. In the Lower Cretaceous the probable mean
annual temperature in latitude 71° north is stated as 21° to 22°
centigrade, while in the early Tertiary it is estimated at 12° centigrade.
Such temperatures, ranging from 71° to 53° of Fahrenheit,
represent a marvellously warm climate for so high a latitude. In
point of fact, however, the evidence of warm climates in the arctic
regions, in the Palæozoic as well as in the Mesozoic and early Tertiary,
should perhaps lead us to conclude that, relatively to the whole
of geological time, the present arctic climate is unusually severe, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">« 284 »</a></span>
that a temperate climate in the arctic regions has throughout geological
time been the rule rather than the exception.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="caption2"><a name="APPENDIX_III" id="APPENDIX_III"></a>III.&mdash;MINERALISATION OF FOSSIL PLANTS.</p>


<p>The state of preservation of fossil plants has been referred to
incidentally in several places in the text; but the following more
definite statements may be of service to the reader.</p>

<p>I. Organic remains imbedded in aqueous deposits may occur in
an unchanged condition, or only more or less altered by decay. This
is often the case with such enduring substances as bark and wood,
and even with leaves, which appear as thin carbonaceous films when
the layers containing them are split open. In the more recent deposits
such remains occur little modified, or perhaps only slightly
changed by partial decay of their more perishable parts. In the
older formations, however, they are usually found in a more or
less altered condition, in which their original substance has been
wholly or in part changed into coaly, or bituminous, or anthracitic
or graphitic matter, so that leaves are sometimes represented by stains
of graphite, as if drawn on stone with a lead-pencil. Yet even in
this case some portion of the original substance remains, and without
any introduction of foreign material.</p>

<p>II. On the other hand, such remains are often mineralised by the
filling of their pores or the replacement of their tissues with mineral
matter, so that they become hard and stony, and sometimes retain
little or nothing of their original substance. The more important
of these changes, in so far as they affect fossil plants, may be arranged
under the following heads:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Infiltration</i> of mineral matter which has penetrated the pores
of the fossil in a state of solution. Thus the pores of fossil wood
are often filled with calcite, quartz, oxide of iron, or sulphide of iron,
while the woody walls of the cells and vessels remain in a carbonised
state, or converted into coaly matter. When wood is preserved in
this way it has a hard and stony aspect; but we can sometimes dissolve
away the mineral matter, and restore the vegetable tissue to a
condition resembling that before mineralisation. This is especially
the case when calcite is the mineralising substance. We sometimes
find, on microscopic examination, that even cavities so small as those
of vegetable cells and vessels have been filled with successive coats
of different kinds of mineral matter.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Organic matters may be entirely <i>replaced</i> by mineral substances.
In this case the cavities and pores have been first filled,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">« 285 »</a></span>
and then&mdash;the walls or solid parts being removed by decay or solution&mdash;mineral
matter, either similar to that filling the cavities, or
differing in colour or composition, has been introduced. Silicified
wood often occurs in this condition. In the case of silicified wood,
it sometimes happens that the cavities of the fibers have been filled
with silica, and the wood has been afterward removed by decay,
leaving the casts of the tubular fibers as a loose filamentous substance.
Some of the Tertiary coniferous woods of California are in
this state, and look like asbestus, though they show the minute
markings of the tissue under the microscope. In the case of silicified
or agatized woods, it would seem that the production of carbon dioxide
from the decaying wood has caused the deposition of silica in
its place, from alkaline solutions of that substance, and thus the
carbon has been replaced, atom by atom, by silicon, until the whole
mass has been silicified, yet retaining perfectly its structure.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The cavities left by fossils which have decayed may be filled
with clay, sand, or other foreign matter, and this, becoming subsequently
hardened into stone, may constitute a <i>cast</i> of the fossils.
Trunks of trees, roots, &amp;c., are often preserved in this way, appearing
as stony casts, often with the outer bark of the plant forming a carbonaceous
coating on their surfaces. In connection with this state
may be mentioned that in which, the wood having decayed, an entire
trunk has been flattened so as to appear merely as a compressed film
of bark, yet retaining its markings; and that in which the whole of
the vegetable matter having been removed, a mere impression of
the form remains.</p>

<p>Fossils preserved in either of the modes, (<i>a</i>) or (<i>b</i>), usually show
more or less of their minute structures under the microscope. These
may be observed:&mdash;(1) By breaking off small splinters or flakes and
examining them, either as opaque or as transparent objects. (2) By
treating the material with acids, so as to dissolve out the mineral
matters, or portions of them. This method is especially applicable
to fossil woods mineralised with calcite or pyrite. (3) By grinding
thin sections. These are first polished on one face on a coarse stone
or emery hone, and then on a fine hone, then attached by the polished
face to glass slips with a transparent cement or Canada balsam, and
ground on the opposite face until they become so thin as to be translucent.
In most cities there are lapidaries who prepare slices of this
kind; but the amateur can readily acquire the art by a little practice,
and the necessary appliances can be obtained through dealers
in minerals or in microscopic materials. Very convenient cutting
and polishing machines, some of them quite small and portable, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">« 286 »</a></span>
now made for the use of amateurs. In the case of exogenous woods,
three sections are necessary to exhibit the whole of the structures.
One of these should be transverse and two longitudinal, the latter in
radial and tangential planes.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="APPENDIX_IV" id="APPENDIX_IV"></a>IV.&mdash;GENERAL WORKS ON PALÆOBOTANY.</p>


<p>In the text frequent reference has been made to special memoirs
and reports on the fossil plants of particular regions or formations.
There are, however, some general books, useful to students, which
may be mentioned here. Perhaps the most important is Schimper&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Traité de Paléontologie Végétale.&rdquo; Very useful information is
also contained in Renault&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cours de Botanique Fossile,&rdquo; and in
Balfour&rsquo;s &ldquo;Introduction to Palæontological Botany,&rdquo; and Nicholson&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Palæontology.&rdquo; Unger&rsquo;s &ldquo;Genera et Species,&rdquo; Brongniart&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Histoire des Végétaux Fossiles,&rdquo; and Lindley and Button&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fossil
Flora,&rdquo; are older though very valuable works. Williamson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Memoirs,&rdquo;
in the &ldquo;Philosophical Transactions,&rdquo; have greatly advanced
our knowledge of the structures of Palæozoic plants. Lastly, the
&ldquo;Palæophytology&rdquo; of Schenk, now in course of publication in German
and French, in connection with Zittel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Palæontology,&rdquo; is an
important addition to manuals of the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this excellent translation of Professor Haeckel&rsquo;s work, the English
reader has access to the latest doctrines of the Continental school of
evolution, in its application to the history of man. It is in Germany, beyond
any other European country, that the impulse given by Darwin
twenty years ago to the theory of evolution has influenced the whole
tenor of philosophical opinion. There may be, and are, differences in
the degree to which the doctrine may be held capable of extension into
the domain of mind and morals; but there is no denying, in scientific
circles at least, that as regards the physical history of organic nature
much has been done toward making good a continuous scheme of being.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London

<p>&ldquo;This volume contains the record of various experiments made with ants,
bees, and wasps during the last ten years, with a view to test their menial condition
and powers of sense. The principal point in which Sir John&rsquo;s mode of
experiment differs from those of Huber, Forel, McCook, and others, is that he
has carefully watched and marked particular insects, and has had their nests
under observation for long periods&mdash;one of his ants' nests having been under
constant inspection ever since 1874 His observations are made principally upon
ants, because they show more power and flexibility of mind; and the value of
his studies is that they belong to the department of original research.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have no hesitation in saying that the author has presented us with the
most valuable series of observations on a special subject that has ever been produced,
charmingly written, full of logical deductions, and, when we consider his
multitudinous engagements, a remarkable illustration of economy of time. As a
contribution to insect psychology, it will be long before this book finds a
parallel.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London Athenæum.</i></p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
